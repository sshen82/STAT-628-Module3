The server immediately removed my plate and let the chef know of the error.  The server said the steak would take 14 minutes to cook.  By then my husband would be done eating his meal.  So I sat there watching my husband eat his meal.  My husband ordered the blackened halibut, I took at bite and the fish was very dry and burned around the edges.  I tasted the carrots and the they were not cooked all the way, they were still hard.  The baked potato was the size of a roma tomato and it was also dry.  What a waste of time and money.  I spoke with Marie the manager and she came across as not caring and let me know that my steak was removed from my bill.  I would have been very upset had she charged me for a meal I did not eat. She didn't do anything to have me want to come back.  Save your money and go to a more reputable restaurant that knows how to serve delicious meals.\",\n",

Clams from New England, Steak from New Zealand, Crabs from Maryland, etc. My first experience was a weeknight in August with a friend. We were fortunate to be seated in Toni's section. Toni is knowledgable, friendly and offered fantastic suggestions. \\n\\nThe oysters were incredible, very large and flavorful. It was my first time having turtle soup and I was very impressed - Salt Cellar delivered on all the build up of the controversial dish. The sauteed scallops were exceptional. I tried to request a quart of the sauce to-go, but to no avai. The crowning glory is the Maryland Crab Cakes. They have large pieces of Crab, with only enough of the other ingredients to hold it together. They are grilled to a crispy goodness. I have returned 4 more times, and always order them.\\n\\nThe restaurant is an actual cellar, making for fun conversation - be sure to check out the ceiling carefully. The restaurant atmosphere is a balance between upscale and comfortable - great for romantic dinner or family events. On weekends, it's a popular date place. The bar offers a slightly more casual atmosphere. Alex the bartender is personable and makes a great drink.\\n\\nThis place is an excellent choice for both tourists, locals and regulars.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Who'd have thought that in a part of the country where basements are nonexistent, there's a fantastic restaurant that's entirely underground? Salt Cellar has always been my favorite place for sea food in the valley. The quality of the fish is always good and fresh, especially when you consider that Arizona is a landlocked state. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner at the Salt Cellar. She can't eat shell fish, which eliminates a lot of the items on the menu, but there's plenty of good options to pick from. We split a Halibut ceviche appetizer, which may have been the best ceviche I've ever had. Nothing against shrimp, but the Halibut is much more flavorful. I had Swordfish with mango salsa. The mango salsa was unreal. They left everything cut in big chunks, which was a little shocking at first, but it covered the whole fish, and was quite tasty. The fish itself tasted a little dry to me at first, but as I got to the center, I found that it was perfectly cooked, and the salsa continued to enhance the flavor. My girlfriend had Mahi. I tried a bite, and it was also delicious. \\n\\nEntrees are around the prices you'd expect to pay at this type of establishment. But orders come with a salad, vegetables, and choice of potato or rice. Two glasses of wine, an appetizer, and two entrees cost a little more than $100 (not including tip). Not bad for a special occasion. \\n\\nThe place is very small (be prepared to be seated a little too close to the party next to) so reservations are a must. For parties of two, you can make them on Salt Cellar's website. They only thing I think Salt cellar needs is an update. While the dim lighting, wood and nautical theme is cool. The walls and art hanging on them walk a fine line between out of date and nostalgic.\",\n",

But glad I did because they were still pretty busy even for a Thursday. \\n\\nWe started off with the sauteed shrimp san remo that our server recommend and I have to say it was amazing!! Our serve even told us to dip our bread in the sauce and I couldn't stop eating it. I almost wished we had ordered a second one. Would highly recommend getting the sauteed shrimp san remo as your appetizer. \\n\\nFor my entree I got the sauteed sea scallops and add the crab legs as well. They crack the crab for you table side so you don't have to work for your crab which I think is great! My entree was very good, I very much enjoyed both the scallops and the crab was awesome! Almost wished I had just ordered a bigger crab entree. My husband got the beef wellington and crab legs as well. He very much enjoyed the wellington and he couldn't get enough of the crab either! \\n\\nWe had a great time over all and were very happy with everything we ordered. We would for sure go back here and eat dinner again!\",\n",

We were then seated within 5 minutes. We started off with muscles and three different breads with broth and butter as dipping sauces. Very delicious! As for our main dishes, hubby ordered the halibut with lemon and caper butter and I ordered the Alaskan king crab legs which both dishes were shared. Diana, our fabulous waitress, cracked the crab legs for us at our table so it was easier to eat. For dessert, we shared the amaretto cheese cake, which was very tasty and not overly sweet. \\nFor those who are slightly claustrophobic, you actually don't feel so closed in with the restaurant being underground, so I don't think it would be a problem. It was a great experience with delicious food, elegant, but casual ambiance & wonderful service! They have a separate bar service to make sure your drinks are full throughout dinner. \\n\\nIt's such a neat and romantic place to dine for any special occasion!\\n\\nHighly recommend this place!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So I came here on a whim because it was a Sunday night and most places were already closed so my options were limited. I wanted something quick and they\\'re open until 1:00 am, I had this place already bookmarked so I said \"why not?\" because at that point I was starving! It\\'s located off the beaten path in the south east area of Scottsdale and when I approached the building I was confused because it looked like nothing was there!\\n\\nWhen I walked in the door......wow what a surprise! It\\'s LITERALLY a cellar lol! You walk down this really nice all wood staircase and wood walls/ceiling, dark with movie theater type lighting guiding the path and a chandelier to top it off of course! I finally got to the bottom where I saw a guy and asked \"am I in the right place?\" because I didn\\'t notice the sign saying where the heck I was! He laughed and said yes. I asked if I could get something to go and he said I could but I wanted the crab cakes with vegetables and I could only dine in to get it. I said why not it\\'ll be a quick bite so I agreed and followed another lady to my seat.\\n\\nI got to the dining area and man! I was not expecting a 5 star type dining place! Dim lighting, relaxing music, setting the mood perfectly. Everyone was all dressed up and I walk in with a regular blouse and jeans, whatever. Hostess sits me down then I\\'m greeted by ANOTHER person who asks if I wanted some wine to start off with, me not being a wine connoisseur I nicely declined the offer but I took a water and told him I was ready to order. Didn\\'t even look at the menu so honestly I didn\\'t know price of the meal before I ordered! He started me off with some bread and a side salad, salad was amazing and a meal itself (bread not so much, a little too bland and dry)! I order crab cakes with vegetables and a baked potato, the wait for a simple order was kind of ridiculous in my opinion, or maybe I was just really hungry, but I think they could\\'ve brought it out sooner than they did.\\n\\nI finally get my entrée and the presentation was beautiful! Nicely plated, and they put a lemon cut open into a star shaped with some chilé on top, awesome! Baked potato with just chives was pretty good, and the vegetables with a light cheese sauce was great! Saving the review for the crab cakes for last because.....this is where the 4 stars comes in. Crab cakes could have been much better in my opinion, I like crab cakes to have big chunks of crab and less breading. These crab cakes had a lot of crab, however it was shredded crab so the texture was really hard to get used to  because it was kind of mushy and just didn\\'t taste as good as a chunky crab cake. The flavors were there however! All in all I enjoyed majority of my meal (just not the main item unfortunately). The price was a reasonable price for the service that I received, it would have gotten 5 stars if I enjoyed the crab cake as much as I enjoyed everything else and if it didn\\'t take so long my for my food to arrive. I will come back but I will try something else next time.',\n",

Upon arrival for our resevation we descended the stairs to the \"cellar\" where we were greeted and shown to our table right away. We were seated in a dimly lit dining room with a few other couples, and despite what other Yelpers have complained about, we did not feel the least bit crowded!\\n\\nOn to the food!! We ordered the bucket of steamed clams for an appetizer (looking back I wish I had ordered the escargot as well). They were steamed to perfection with good texture and flavor, and served with drawn butter and a clam wash! For my entree I ordered the Blackened Sea Bass and my wife ordered the Baked Stuffed Lobster at the recommendation on MANY Yelpers! Our meals were amazing! My fish was seared to a light crisp outside, but was still soft and full of flavor inside! Her lobster was stuffed with WHOLE sea scallops and jumbo lump MD blue crab meat! Our waiter Tony even cracked it for her at our table!\\n\\nAll in all I\\'m very impressed with the Salt Cellar... food AND service! Don\\'t believe the bad reviews out there.

It has a very cool vibe as you park and walk down stairs to main area of the restaurant. It has a rustic/80-90's fine dining vibe but the staff is courteous energetic without being overbearing. It seems like they work together as you will typically have a server for the night but someone else who takes care of drinks. Respectable selection of wines and liquor. I paid the bill but didn't want to look at the breakdown of what my drinks cost :) . This not for coupon or penny pincher folk but definitely a good experience. The first time I came I had the lobster with stuffed crab but I told myself I would get something else this time. I was starving so couldn't settle for just crab legs or crab cakes. Wasnt planning on a surf turf kinda night but I knew it would fill me up. My mom had the grouper grilled with the blackened (cajun seasoning). We both had the mixed veggies and salads. We all tried the turtle soup just so we could say we had it and Manhattan clam chowder as well. I actually prefer teh tomato base instead of the creamy one because that tends be lots of chunks of potatoes. We had the halibut ceviche and the shrimp mushroom appetizer. It was funny that we were more focused on dipping the bread in the sauce than eating the actual shrimp. The shrimp were semi dinky in size but we had plenty of other food to keep us happy. Creme brule to seal the deal and perfect way to end the night. Thank you good people of Salt Cellar for a respectable seafood meal in the desert\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Not being a fish person (so take that as you wish) my mother wanted to take my wife and I with my daughter here for dinner because she likes it (on Friday 6/10/2016). I found the whole experience to be very overpriced for the quality they deliver. Starting with the parking lot.\\n\\nI started with the Turtle soup, being from Philadelphia, Snapper soup was a staple at a restaurant there. Although the Salt Cellar\\'s soup lacked seasoning (and lazily puts the sherry on the side) I didn\\'t think it was that bad. I\\'d give it a 3/5.\\n\\nSalad dressings choices leave to be desired, and I can\\'t eat mushrooms -- but the waiter never told us they had mushrooms and by the next time I saw him our entree was there.\\n\\nI had the Beef Wellington, and so did my daughter. We both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings. The raspberry syrup they dump on it is absolutely awful. It totally killed the whole thing, but I suppose when they don\\'t season it, that\\'s what you should expect -- heavy syrups.  And definitely not Grade A cuts, nothing more than you can buy at a supermarket (for the lower grades)\\n\\nMy wife had the salmon which she said was okay, they spend more time in presentation than flavoring again.\\n\\nThe free desert they give us for our anniversary for chocolate cake seemed liked they found a  stale doughnut from a store and microwaved it with chocolate sauce. Good thing we didn\\'t pay for that.\\n\\nI\\'d say this place is overpriced by at least 200-300% given the quality. The staff is friendly, but the waiter doesn\\'t get you drinks, some cocktail one does -- so be prepared to get everything different. The beer she refilled wasn\\'t the same I had (nor did she ask) and she refilled my mom\\'s Gin and Tonic with Sprite -- but charged us for a Gin and Tonic.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t eat half the meal as the sides were barely edible - the kus was nothing but water and the broccoli and cauliflower had some sauce on it that made it taste and smell \"off\". The baked potato was microwaved and not even scrubbed. \\n\\nNot one elicit response from the waiter, cocktail waitress, or even a manager to come up and ask what\\'s wrong given that we barely ate 30% of the meal. I\\'m guessing they just bank on overpriced, completely under-quality food and hope that people still believe this is some type of \"place to be seen\" given its Scottsdale address.\\n\\nI\\'d expect more from a place that averages about $60 a plate with tip and drinks -- you should also. Their management seems to have no issues with it.',\n",

On the day I came here, I missed the exit from the freeway and was driving up Hayden Rd to get back to Scottsdale eventually, when my friend said there should be a good seafood restaurant nearby, and when he spotted this place, we decided to try here instead.\\n\\nTaking the stairs down, I felt like I was going down to a wine cellar. It's such an old school, I felt like I was back in time. Apparently they haven't changed for over 40 years. I liked their classy ambiance. \\n\\nServer said halibut was fresh so we shared halibut ceviche. Fish was fresh and really liked the taste of ceviche. It was so hot that night, fresh appetizer was perfect choice.\\n\\nYakimono Hawaiian ahi had a great flavor. One of the best ahi I had before. Outside was charred just perfectly, I enjoyed every bite of my ahi.\\n\\nPortion size was very big. I didn't have enough room left in my tummy for desert. \\n\\nServer was as friendly as he gets.

For dinner we had the ahi, of course, the crab legs, and the salmon Oscar. (I am actually headed back for dinner tonight, because it was all amazing.) We also enjoyed 2 bottles of wine.

The rice and vegetables had less seasoning than a retirement home. We ordered calamari and it was pretty good, and the bread was decent too. \\nI feel bad for the staff that they have to serve\\nSuch mediocre food.

       "  'text': \"My hubby is obsessed with crab legs, so every year for his birthday I take him out to places I know he can order them. He is always down for Red Lobster, but ugh I'm not, so I searched for an alternative. We had been to Salt Cellar once before, but that was about 4 years ago, so I thought we should check it out again. I made reservations for Saturday at 8pm, but I let them know we were running 30 minutes late & they said that was totally fine because they were a bit backed up that night. We only had to wait about 10 minutes & our table was ready. The dining room is small, I'd guess there were only about 12 tables in there. We got an awkwardly placed table that faced everyone, & since it was up against a wall we had to sit side by side. It sucked but oh well, we were so late I was glad they still sat us! I do love how this place is underground, but the decor is so boring/dated!\\n\\nI can't remember our server's name but he was very nice & checked on us often. For starters we got the bucket of steamed mussels with sides of plain butter & butter with herbs. This bucket seemed bottomless, I swear there were at least 50 mussels in there! One thing that bothered me about this app was that it smelled fishy to me, didn't taste fishy though so we didn't get sick, but still. The complimentary bread & whipped butter they brought out was pretty good. Onto our entrees; hubby got the king crab legs (1.5 lbs) & I got the baked stuffed lobster. Both meals came with a salad, veggies & rice or baked potato. They cracked his crab legs & my lobster at the table & then we dug in. Hubs loved his crab, the meat was fresh & sweet. My lobster was ok, the crab, scallops & bread stuffing were too much for me, I would just order a regular lobster in the future. \\n\\nTotal for one cocktail, an app & 2 entrees was about $130 (not including tip). While the food was pretty good & 4 star worthy, I felt it was overpriced & the place lacked any ambiance, so I think 3 stars is appropriate.\",\n",

Complaining (politely) only garnered more mediocre food along with a poor attitude.  Tonight we thought, Oh, we\\'ll just try the bar for happy hour. Scott greeted us and seemed pleasant but Dale actually managed to take our order and deliver it without uttering a word. In fact, I thought he was not going to say a word at all until we left. But he must have overheard me telling my husband that NOTHING ( mussels or any of the mystery dipping sauces they came with ) had ANY flavor. The only thing I noticed was a strong smell of sewer. Anyway,  he said \" oh! So Is your stuff any good?\"  I said ,\" Meh. It\\'s ok. but really bland\". At which point he walked away, never to be heard from again. I asked for the check which Scot delivered. The bill was $ 43 and some odd cents and I left $6 and some odd cents. I don\\'t care if he thinks I am cheap (former server, good tipper) because I will not return. Everybody says the economy sucks. I think peoples attitudes suck.

All of the seafood we had was overcooked: lobster, stuffed shrimp and grouper. I highly doubt that they fly their lobsters in from Maine daily. The vegetables were not fresh or seasonal and the baked potato had no substance. How do you screw up a baked potato??! I think the lighting is so dim because they do not want you to actually see the food on your plate. The dessert, chocolate lava cake, wasn't even good. I grew up on the east coast and love old fashioned seafood restaurants; however, there is no comparison. I couldn't even dent the food on my plate because the thought of eating it made me feel sick. There are too many amazing restaurants in Scottsdale to come here and pay for overpriced, not fresh seafood.\",\n",

It's not the same anymore.\\n\\nWe went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.\\n\\nWe got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.\\n\\nThe food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.\\n\\nWhile I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.\\n\\nSo we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.

Away from the busy streets of old town and mill but close enough to venture there before or after. Plenty of parking.\\n\\nStyle: This restaurant has a classy speakeasy feel but casual attire is fine. The restaurant is open until 12am and the bar open until 1am. It\\'s hard to find someone serving \"upscale\" food  past 10pm so we were excited to check this place out.\\n\\nNow for the very unfortunate part.\\n\\nThe food: Wow, just the worst value ever. We ordered Shrimp Cocktail, 2 glasses of champagne, market bay scallops and lobster stuffed shrimp. \\n\\nFirst we got the bread and champagne. Everything was going great. The bread came in huge slices and was fresh. It didn\\'t come out warm but it was still fresh and tasty. It was served with a whipped butter. I prefer oil myself but it was good. The champagne was great.\\n\\nThen we got our shrimp. It had that refrigerator taste to it. Like it was made earlier in the day and then wrapped in plastic and thrown in the fridge. We could both taste it. It wasn\\'t the worst shrimp ever and we did eat all 5 jumbo shrimp but we were a little turned off already. \\n\\nThen we got our salad. We got the house vinaigrette as a dressing. Salad was fine. Lettuce was fresh. It was presented poorly though. I\\'m not usually a stickler on presentation but if you\\'re charging $40-50 a plate I figured some effort was coming. It looked like a diner salad and for some reason they give you a huge heap of mushrooms on the side. Whatever, salad is a salad. We were still optimistic about this place. It was so cool and classy and close to home that we wanted to love it. Still no real complaints.\\n\\nThen the dinner came. Ew man. Ew. My Scallops were flavorless. I was expecting big scallops seared and delicious. Instead, I got these miniature flavorless scallops served with a side of broccoli covered in some type of sour cream sauce. And this weird seasoned lemon as a garnish. The presentation was horrendous. It looked like a dish you get from a Mexican restaurant.

       "  'text': \"Hello again Arizonians and visitors......\\n\\nI will remind you as alway I am the pickiest person I know and detest spending good money on bad food.\\n\\nI am going to review Salt Cellar while it is fresh on my mind.\\n\\nI was taken here today to celebrate my B-day and I LOVE seafood be it raw or cooked.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar, which mind you is a VERY VERY small area and very busy with servers coming and going with drink orders.\\n\\nThere were at least 2 bartenders that we saw and the first bartender to greet(?)us and I use that term lightly   was Dale. \\n\\nHe was quick to get our drink order and deliver it....so far so good... we ordered several items from the happy hour menu to include a couple of oysters on the 1/2 shell which was very tasty and a couple of oyster shooters...YUM and then on to some scallops, which unfortunately due to the very dim lighting we failed to notice were flash fried...(why anyone would want to fry a tender and tasteful morsel of fish is beyond me).\\n\\nThe scallops arrived and looked unappetizing to say the least and tasted equally as unappetizing.  \\n\\nThey were tasteless to the point if I didnt know what I was eating I would never in a zillion years guess it was a scallop.  My friend agreed that not only did they have a bit of a sour taste were just ...not good!\\n\\nThe last thing we ordered was escargot, this dish is for the folks who enjoy butter and ggarlic.....not my taste but I did try one and again.....tasteless other than the garlic    taste... I enjoy the taste of seafood and this dish did not do it for me.\\n\\nI must reccomend the bread, which is soft and extremely good and I was shocked that they actually charge you for bread when you are spending $50 in food but I will admit I was happy to pay for it.\\n\\nThe prices are not cheap but again, I do not mind spending money on good food....this was NOT it!\\n\\nNow on to the ambiance and service.\\n\\nWhen you enter the restaurant you have to walk down many stairs into restaurant which is underground....very kewl concept unfortunately the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a sauna....very hot and humid ...it overwhelms you....especially when the temps outside are 100 plus......HELLO....THIS IS ARIZONA....USE SOME AIR CONDITIONING!\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier Dale was the first bardenter we saw and as efficient as he was I think he left his personality and smile at home...he did not make us feel welcome at all.\\n \\nOf course its possible there is some other reason he is unfriendly such as he was having a bad day, or he hated his job or......or......or...... nope...no or's.... a bartender should be friendly... I think its in the bardenter code or something.\\n\\nNow, I am not a drinker nor do I frequent bars.....but I did years ago and bartenders used to be friendly...isnt that how you make tips?  Even if you are busy?\\n\\nI had asked an employee his name and we were told he has been working there since 1986?  I am thinking its time for Mr personality to get another job.\\n\\nThis is my opinion of Salt Cellar and it is because of our experience that we will not be returning.\\n\\nI am sure there are wonderful items on the menu that are delicious but the service and food we did try turned us off.\\n\\nIt is my opinion if you want to spend a chunk of money on seafood try someplace else.... or not....its your call, but until you do.....\\n\\nBon Appetite'\",\n",

We had one and we still weren\\'t seated on time.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a unique experience as it\\'s underground.  However, that does make for a pretty crowded space all around.   There seemed to be quite a few people that were there just to hang out in the bar and given the limited space and mild sense of claustrophobia, that is not something I would choose to do.  \\n\\nThe drinks were done well and they have a great selection of spirits at the bar.  The complimentary bread is tasty but the pieces are huge.  Our crab cake starter might well have been my favorite item.  It\\'s super extra crabby and in this case, that is a plus!  \\n\\nThey have a case with \"live\" lobsters but I suspect these guys had at least one claw in the dish.  (That, or they all have a terrible case of the thorazine shuffle.)  My lobster was prepared well enough but it was fairly chewy.  My steak was delicious but it was prepared medium rare rather than the medium I requested.  (Thankfully, the lighting was low which made it difficult to see the clear evidence of murder on my plate.)  The amaretto cheesecake was tasty and you get a little glass of amaretto with it.  \\n\\nIt\\'s hard for me to balk at prices because they\\'re serving fish in the desert.  But know that it\\'s going to be a pretty spendy evening.   \\n\\nGiven that some of our favorite restaurants are just down the road in Old Town, I would probably not choose to come here again.

       "  'text': 'I heard about this mystic underground seafood restaurant by chance and I made a mental note of it. My roommate picked up on it when I explained, as best I could, that this place is essentially a parking lot with a restaurant underneath it. And apparently, the seafood is to die for. So when the next special occasion arose (my birthday), my roommate and I made plans to travel to this netherworld of seafood delicacies and subterranean mystery.\\n\\nThe experience was better than I could\\'ve imagined. First, there was a small crowd waiting for the place to open. Seating is limited, so it can fill up pretty fast. But this added to the adventure feeling, as if we were all on some sort of marine odyssey and we had to gather at the gangplank. We descended into the rustic interior along with the other guests, and then bellied up to the bar to have some appetite-enhancing cocktails before our reservation time. The bar is pretty cool and has a great selection of mixed drinks... I may have to return just for their Happy Hour sometime, and scarf down what looked like a great menu of seafood appetizers.\\n\\nWhen it was our turn to enter The Abyss, rather, the dining room, we were prepared. We had done our research and watched a clip from the local PBS show \"Check, Please! Arizona\" where the reviewers drooled as they described the sauteed shrimp San Remo appetizer. We had to have it! We made sure to indulge in the fresh baked bread in thick-sliced hunks, perfect for sopping up this most heavenly, buttery, garlicky, tomatoey sauce. This is truly a magnificent, superstar dish that I still dream about (despite the buttery stains that soaked through my napkin onto my dress slacks)! This appetizer is so delicious, that I had no problem eating it AND wearing it.\\n\\nMy entree was also quite special. I ordered the mahi mahi (with macadamia nuts), which came with wild rice pilaf and sauteed veggies. I expected this to look like Trout Almondine, with slivered almonds atop. However, the macadamia nuts are actually part of a toothsome, applesauce-like topping which confused me greatly. The sauce definitely has the crushed nuts, but the flavor is a bit sweet and reminiscent of ginger-bread spices. It wasn\\'t until I was several bites deep and I squeezed all of my lemon on the fish, that I understand the genius of the flavors. The lemon really opens it up and lets you experience the delicate texture and savory character of the fish accented with gingery and nutty notes from the sauce. Truly a novel approach to what might otherwise be dismissed as just another white fish dish.\\n\\nAlas, we had a fabulous time at the Salt Cellar. We even got along famously with the couple at the table next to us who were celebrating an anniversary. It seems that the novelty of the underground location and the fabulous food makes for a real treat! I consider my meal here one of my most unique and unforgettable dining experiences.',\n",

It has that private posh bar feel with dim lighting. Try the turtle soup, steamed mussels and the raw oysters. The steamed mussels can be eaten without any sauce. It's that tasty.

It was made clear to the staff that this being a work dinner everyone was to pay for their own liquor and all food was to go on one bill. One of the tables was half way through their meal before the other table received their dinner and we ordered at the same time. When the bill came the staff literally separated each \"beverage\" order (1 coke, 3 teas, etc) so they had to redo the ticket. It was time consuming. The food in all honesty was marginal at best.

We had reservations and we had to wait a bit to be seated but, without any complaints from us, we were apologized to multiple times and offered free cocktails. The people were very genuine and hardworking. Once we were seated there was no lack in service and our needs were addressed immediately. We got our drinks for free, which was fantastic and generous of them. I would return for the service alone... But then we tried the food. Wow. We had the sautéed shrimp San remos and it was so delicious... Very rich, a perfect blend of garlic, butter, portobello mushroom, sun dried tomatoes and who knows what other secret (crack) ingredients. YUM. We couldn't help but dip our bread in the extra sauce. The New England clam chowder was thinner than I've had in the past but full of clams instead of weighed down with endless potatoes-- very tasty. \\nWe ordered steak and an ahi tuna special. The steak was large, juicy and steakhouse quality. The ahi was cooked perfectly-- seared and rare in the center with tasty, but not overwhelmingly blackened, spices. They brought a free dessert for my birthday. Despite telling our superior server, Chuck, that we had no room for dessert, he insisted we get it and take it to go. We got a chocolate lava cake type dessert with raspberry and it was rich and super yummy. \\nEverything was delicious, the service was over-the-top accommodating and we were so very impressed. If you love seafood and want a unique environment with delicious food and outstanding service, please do not miss out on the chance to try The Salt Cellar.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My boyfriend and I went to the Salt Cellar for our anniversary - we saw a Groupon, checked out reviews on Yelp, and decided it would be a good choice.\\n\\nWOW, were we wrong!  Going back over the reviews, I'm convinced that no one in AZ actually knows what fresh seafood looks/tastes like.  It certainly can NOT be found at the Salt Cellar.\\n\\nThe meal started with bread, which was meh.  A seafood place that doesn't serve sourdough?  Odd.  The bread was very plain, even though one slice had olives in it. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we chose crab cakes.  They were at least 50% bread crumbs, had a very slightly canned flavor, and came with a very plain tartar sauce.  Pretty mediocre for $15.  They were cooked nicely, however - nice and crisp on the outside - so we finished them. \\n\\nNext up, salad.  I had Creamy Bleu Cheese and my boyfriend had House.  Again, meh.  The mix was just iceburg lettuce, some carrot shreds, mushrooms, and one cherry tomato.  The house dressing just tasted like vinegar and oil, the bleu cheese was a little musty.\\n\\nThen the main course... at this point, Boyfriend and I were thinking that the entree would at least be as good as the appetizer, but hoping for much better.  Based on reputation, how could it suck?  Oh... it sucked mightily!\\n\\nI had Mahi-Mahi sauteed with Macadamia Nuts (a house specialty), the boyfriend had Salmon Wellington (on their fresh market menu).  \\n\\nSide dishes were a baked potato that was microwaved and a piece of rubbery, inedible broccoli.\\n\\nThe salmon was wrapped in spinach, then in puff pastry, kind of like beef wellington, and served with hollandaise. Sounds promising, right?  It was over cooked, mushy, and tasted old.  The hollandaise tasted like plain butter.  Pretty bad, but still a little edible.  Red Lobster-level quality at triple the price.\\n\\nThe Mahi-Mahi was a disaster!  It was definitely not fresh fish, and actually seemed like it had been cooked hours before I ate it.  It was lukewarm and rubbery, with a pile of candied macadamia's on top.  Even if it had been cooked well, the seasoning and flavor was way too sweet.  After a few terrible, mushy bites, I cut open to the middle - the inside was GRAY and mealy.  DISGUSTING.  I didn't eat any more of it.\\n\\nIn any decent restaurant, if the server sees that the patron hasn't eaten any of their meal, they'll ask what's wrong and try to make it right.  Our waiter didn't even raise an eyebrow.  Either it's poor service or it happens all the time.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, for $100 we got two sodas ($8 for those!), some plain bread, mediocre crab cakes, overcooked old salmon, and pre-cooked possibly near expiration Mahi.  For a meal this quality, save your money and go to Red Lobster.  At least you'll get cheddar bay biscuits!\",\n",

We wanted to do something out of our normal box so we headed to The Salt Cellar (bonus as it's super close to our house) and we got there about 15 minutes to spare before happy hour ended. We found two spots at the side bar but decided that if two seats opened up at the bar we'd take those...well, two opened up and we sat right down. We looked at the menu and quickly ordered so we could still get the happy hour prices. I had 1/2 dozen oysters, escargot, and an oyster shooter, my boyfriend had the clam chowder and shrimp cocktail. We also each ordered a drink. Our bartender Alex was awesome!!!! My oysters came out and they were AMAZING! I cannot wait to go back and get more! My boyfriend really enjoyed his shrimp cocktail as well. Then my escargot came out and it was so garlicy and good!!!! The clam chowder was also very satisfying.

The menu seems to have not been updated since the restaurants inception. The chef could easily add some modern flair to it, update the bread (it's literally a Sara Lee dinner roll), add some variety in the seasoning of fish. The swordfish and halibut were not very flavorful. I know Arizona is landlocked, but I've had better fish in Colorado. Not sure about their meat, but perhaps that's what is best to order. The salad with the tarragon dressing was delicious. \\nService: Mediocre, the server seemed to be overworked but she was pleasant. \\nDrinks: Good wine selection, this is not a place for craft cocktails\\n\\nOverall, I will not return there again.

Our server Scott, was excellent.\\n\\nNot sure where all the 4-5 stars are, but this place seems to have missed the boat for us. I should of gotten the clue when I specifically ordered a Cosmo, not too sweet and it came the color of a maraschino cherry and there was a cherry in it. I did not order a Shirley Temple, I ordered a Cosmo.\\n\\nHaving cocktails while pursuing the menu, we decided on appetizers of the Clam Chowder, 1/2 Oysters, and the Crab Cake. Entrees were the New York Strip Steak, Stuffed Shrimp and the Mussels as an entree. Note all entrees are with a Salad, choice of starch, and vegetable. \\n\\nClam Chowder tasted good but consistency was way off like watery (not creamy and thick). Oysters were a good size served with cocktail sauce, where was the horseradish sauce? (always served hand in hand) and had to ask twice for it. Crab cake was very good but for $18 for 1, the tarter sauce it came with tasted and looked like it came out of a jar. Salad, nothing special, croutons out of a box? The New York Strip was a big cut of meat, cooked perfectly, but little to no seasoning. Stuffed Shrimp looked like it was pre-made, patted down into one pile of mush in the dish and heated up, was just very unappealing. Mussels size and quality were very good, perfectly cooked, but they were just steamed, no seasoning in the steaming so they were flavorless. The 2 options of butter dipping sauces were horrible, no taste in the butter at all and I don't know what the other dipping sauce was, but it was not good.\\n\\nThe Restaurant is NOT CHEAP $200+ for a party of 3 for what we ordered, by any standards and for the cost it should be much better in taste. It just missed the mark.\",\n",

The concept is fun - walking down steps into a \"cellar\". The restaurant is not what you expected (in a good way). It\\'s dimly lit, cozy, and intimate. I absolutely loved the ambiance! It would be a great place to go on a date or bring a parent for a nice dinner. We grabbed a seat by the bar and ordered our dirty martinis. It was made pretty well. The bartenders seemed pretty busy so it was hard to get anything, but they were always nice when they did serve us. There were a few gentlemen to our side who ordered a slew of appetizers. Everything looked good! It would be a great place to come for happy hour or reverse happy hour and enjoy good seafood.',\n",

They claim their seafood is flown in from the east coast twice a day so that it's truly fresh and the lobster itself was really tasty it was also a bit rubbery. I had the stake and lobster dinner for $50 which included a good size lobster and a small stake with baked potato and carrots and a salad. The stake just wasn't very good. I don't know how else to say it. I also had Manhattan clam chowder soup for $6 as an appetizer. Now that what excellent! The bread was really good too. I had a $6 Margarita that was OK but it was a very small amount and was gone in about 3 sips. To sum it up, the price of my meal was not justified by the taste and I probably won't be returning any time soon.\",\n",

We planned on having appetizers at the bar but the bartender Daniel was so rude we moved to a table so we could be served by someone who would actually take our order. We typically start with the San\\nRemo . Unfortunately the chef must have quit and taken the recipe with him because this was not the San Remo I used to dream about. It tasted like it was swimming in Tabasco sauce ,the shrimp were tiny and overcooked. The shrimp\\ncocktail was so bad we had to send it back. Even the server said she wasn't sure what the stringy things were hanging off the shrimp???  We should have run for the door at this point but we were starving and couldn't imagine that every item we ordered would be so lackluster and void of flavor. The Salt Cellar is expensive and with all the new restaurants opening that actually care about the quality of food they prepare and offer excellent service we intend to spend our hard earned money elsewhere. Goodbye Salt Cellar it was a good run while it lasted.\",\n",

They use to have amazing bread. But now they have these dense tasteless rolls. It was a great night when I could go for happy hour and enjoy a beer and dip my bread in my San Remo and savor the goodness. Oh and they use to have the best bartenders. They would greet you with a smile and looked genuinely happy. I realize the service industry is stressful and hard on the feet. I believe my breaking point was reached when I went there on a slow Monday night and the bartender looked perturbed by our presence. I found myself apologizing to him that I had to order another drink and more appetizers. I believe it's the end of an era. Gone are the days of great service and food fit for kings for the older restaurants. They're are several places in Scottsdale that have popped up and are giving the Salt Cellar a run for its money.

We ordered the filet and king crab legs filet tasted like a denny\\'s steak, tough, no flavor, had to chew it a lot. Crab was just steamed also no flavor the butter was plain needed garlic or salt or anything for that matter. my grandma had the lobster stuffed with scallops and crab meat, also NO flavor it was all plain again with the plain butter. I was surprised it looked amazing better then the king crab and filet. Last but not least I had the Salmon under thier favorites with the dill topping. It was very small again no flavor the veggies tasted like something out of a frozen bag. Im not being harsh, I\\'m serious. The baked potato was probably the best thing on the plate. The appetizer shrimp was good also but that is it. Even though it was not the best experience the waitress was awesome and the environment was cool minus ut being hot. Then to top the cake on the walk out the hostess made smart remark just so I could hear it about me changing my reservation from four to five, \" thats the one who changed from 4 to 5\" like who really cares the more the better more money better tip. \\nReally sucked!!

An abundance of shrimp in a perfectly seasoned garlic sauce, with pasta, fresh parmesean, and an artichoke heart on top. I took home a large amount. They are very generous with portion size. Key Lime pie for dessert; not too tangy & not to sweet. Every bite of food at this place was a taste of heaven. My husband had the scallops and said they were tasty and cooked perfectly as well.   My compliments to the chef. Scott G. took care of us and he provided very high quality service.

       "  'text': 'Had cocktails at bar before dinner with colleagues and customer.  Ordered a Mum Napa champagne split at the bar with cocktail server #18, which was wonderful and have had many times.  Before cocktails were done we were shown to our table.  I ordered another Mum Napa split when seated. The dinner server came and was telling us about the menu and chatting with us.  During this process cocktail server #18 brought my champagne and set it down.   After the menu process with our dinner server, I noticed there was not a split bottle next to my glass(it usually fills glass with some left in bottle) but didn\\'t think much of it.  I took several sips of my drink and noticed a big difference in taste and not having the bottle I was pretty sure it wasn\\'t a Mum Napa but maybe the Prosecco that is also offered.  When cocktail server #18 came by again, I discreetly asked her if this was a Mum.  I did not want to make a scene or anything close to that with business colleagues there. Cocktail server #18 said indiscreetly, \"you saw me pour it, it was a Mum\".  Whether I saw her pour it or not was irrelevant. You do not respond to a customer with a comment like that and a tone of voice like that.  I actually do not remember her pouring it with everything that was going on at that time and maybe I would have if the bottle had been left with remainder of the Mum. After that encounter, cocktail server #18 became pretty condescending.  They did take it off the ticket which they should have because it either wasn\\'t a Mum or it was a bad split bottle.  If I heard one of my employees talk to a customer like that, they would be dismissed or put on \"cleaning the wine glasses\" duty for a week.   Otherwise, the food was fine, the dinner server was great, and enjoyed being with colleagues and friends.',\n",

       "  'text': 'We had been wanting to try the Salt Cellar for years, having heard good word of mouth and mostly positive reviews.  We wanted to like it.  We really really did, but our experience was less than stellar.  We started in the bar for happy hour.  This was, for the most part, the highlight of our evening.  The happy hour food is reasonably priced.  The same can\\'t be said for the tiny overpriced drinks.  Obviously what you save in food cost is made up on the drinks.  We had raw oysters, raw clam, halibut ceviche, and the shrimp san remo, which is a signature dish of the Salt Cellar.  the oysters, at $1.50 each, were a bargain.  Plump, briny and with just enough \"chew\" to give them substance.  Served with an average cocktail sauce and lemon wedges, it seemed we were off to a good start.  Same for the ceviche (I believe it was about $8.00).  Bathed in a flavorful lime juice, the moist fresh chopped halibut was ensconced in a bed of chopped onion tomato and herbs.  Again, delicious and refreshing.  Just \\'ok\\' was the Shrimp San Remo (about $12.00).  Eight medium shrimp in a spicy sauce which also included portabello mushroom pieces.  While tasty with just enough spice to keep it interesting, the sauce was a bit overly oily.  Our waitress brought us a basket of bread and the oiliness didn\\'t stop us from sopping up the tasty sauce.  Although my stomach did not appreciate the grease later!  Now the bad.  The clams ($1.50 each) had gone south.  They had a rancidness to them that was very off putting. We brought it to our waitress\\' attention and she offered to exchange them for oysters, which was ok, but when we got our bill, we had been charged for the extra oysters.  Not a huge deal, but when you drop almost $90.00 just for happy hour, it would have been nice if the oysters had been comped or at least offer to buy us a drink. \\n\\nOn to the dining room.  First, the whole restaurant is in need of a major decor remodel.  Not saying change the charming theme, but get the mustiness out and update the upholstery, carpet and tacky pictures on the walls.  Just freshen it a bit.  then whole decor harkened back to those rotten clams.\\n\\nThe wait staff is professional enough, nothing particularly outstanding, but capable and attentive without being a perpetual shadow.\\n\\nI ordered the scallops in crab/shrimp cream sauce (about $35.00)and my date ordered the stuffed lobster (about $45.00).  Both came with an average mixed dinner salad and a bread basket.  When my dish came, I was a little surprised  to see that there was no accompaniment, just the n\\\\entree.  No veggie, which would have been fine if the dish wasn\\'t so miserly on the scallops.  Only four lonely, medium sized scallops floating in a soupy pink \"sauce\".  The sauce had a faint taste of fishy cream and little other flavor. It had shreds of crab meat that seemed out of a can and those tiny little shrimp that have no flavor whatsoever.  The scallops were overcooked so they were rubbery.   The aforementioned cream sauce added nothing to the dish and the mound of white rice in the middle of it all only served as a reminder as to the minuteness of the actual seafood in this dish.  Not at all a bargain for the cost.\\n\\nMy companions dish didn\\'t fare much better.  The lobster was decent size but grossly over cooked.  The soggy vegetable accompanying it had no flavor, and the stuffing was dry and flavorless as well.  There was a nice surprise of about three scallops in the stuffing.  Perhaps they had crawled off my dish to keep warm, which would account for the amount I received.  She also elected the lemon rice.  Perhaps a bloodhound could detect a faint whiff of  lemon, but we sure couldn\\'t.  \\n\\nThe Salt Cellar clientele seem to be a bit on the older side, which might account for the lack of seasonings, or perhaps they think the seafood can speak for itself. Well, if the seafood was fresher and cooked properly, perhaps that would be ok.  But given the circumstances, it NEEDED A FLAVOR INJECTION!\\n\\nIf this were a medium or lower priced seafood restaurant, I could give them a pass, but I dropped over $240.00 between the happy hour, dinner and tips and in no way was what we were served worth that.  they charge high-end restaurant, premium seafood prices but deliver sub-par food and just ok service.  It\\'s apparent that there are quite a few people that like this place and are repeat customers.  We won\\'t be counted amongst them, although we might consider coming again for happy hour',\n",

I love blackened dishes but hate it when a place can\\'t do it right so I was skeptical when she recommended the blackened ahi tuna. Kara stated with no delay that not only would I be happy with it but to \"just close the menu now, you won\\'t be disappointed\" !!! Boy was she right!

       "  'text': \"I love the Salt Cellar for being the lazy woman's go-to place for seafood.  If you get lobster or crab from them, the waitress will crack and de-shell it for you; it's such a great service since a lot of the time I am hesitant to get any kind of crustacean because I don't like getting messy and spending all that time getting the meat out of the shell.  The lobster here, while technically from Maine, is flown in fresh from Boston, and they offer 1.25 lb, 3 lb, and occasionally a showcase jumbo lobster.  When I went here they were touting an 8 lb lobster for those with the stomach (and coin) to spend a pretty penny on the Yao Ming of lobsters.\\n\\nWhile the sides are very basic, the seafood is understandably the real star of the show.  While I was happy with my fresh lobster, I did try some salmon wellington, which was some of the best tasting salmon I've had in some time.  It was very tender and moist, and very fresh.  I'm also happy to report that they have soft shell crabs here this season, which is one of my favorite seafood items.\\n\\nThe ambiance itself, for me at least, is a bit lacking.  They don't call it the Salt Cellar for nothing, for when you descend into the restaurant through a flight of stairs, it's very dark and a bit damp and chilly.  The lighting for me is too yellow for me, and everything in general seems antiquated.  I remember eating here years and years ago, and it seems like they haven't changed anything about the decor since then!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I have been to this restaurant twice now, and both times have been a disappointment. The first time my party ordered the surf and turf for each person. Ultimately, the seafood (crab cakes for an appetizer and lobster tail with the meal) were decent - nothing special though as someone who comes from a place where fresh seafood is abundant. As for the filet mignon, it tasted as if someone had basted it in maple syrup. For the prices, I expected the steak to be at least edible (everyone left it on their plates practically untouched after the first bite). The desserts were excellent though, so we took a chance and returned for a birthday this evening planning on sticking to just seafood and desserts.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we never even made it to our table. The staff made an error and didn\\'t put us in line to be seated, which was an error I would have been more than willing to overlook despite waiting almost thirty minutes past our reservation time. People make mistakes. No big deal. My issue came with their handling of the matter though. After speaking with the hostess we continued to wait, never saw a manager or anyone come over to say so much as \"sorry for the wait - can we get you anything while we clear your table?\", and the only time they even appeared to feel badly was when we left and took our money with us. The single exception to this was the bartender who saw us waiting and chose to comp our sodas before we left, and if anyone at your establishment reads this review please know that your bartender is about the only good thing we experienced while there this evening. I\\'ve never gotten such an impression from a restaurant that I\\'m literally just a dollar sign and an inconvenience otherwise. If I\\'m paying $200 for two people to eat, I expect a little more decency from the people running the place than what was evident this evening (sans the excellent bartender). I will not go back and will recommend my friends and family also not bother wasting their time and money there after experiencing both bad food and now similar service.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The husband and I came here for our anniversary and enjoyed it very much. The restaurant was cozy and romantic with an old nostalgic charm. Our waiter rocked and was very quick to refill our drinks and bring our appetizer and meals. He was very friendly and knowing that we were first timers, he explained the menu and was highly informative. We ordered the Shrimp San Remo for appetizer which we probably would not order again. The sauce was flavorful and tasty, however, the shrimp was overcooked. Also, both of us were not happy campers later in the evening and we believe it was because of this appetizer. However, everything else was terrific. For entrées, I opted for the baked stuffed lobster with baked potato and vegi, and the hubby ordered some kind of sauteed scallop special with mushrooms, baked potato, and vegi. Everything tasted fabulous and we were stuffed. One additional note: I love that the waiter offers to crack the lobster crab for you. At the end of our meal when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, our waiter brought us a complimentary slice of snickers cheesecake because it was our anniversary. It was such a nice gesture and I will not lie, the cheesecake was amazing and really did taste like a snickers bar. So in all, this place was very good and a great option for a special occasion. My only complaints were the appetizer (I don't enjoy overcooked shrimp or being in the bathroom for an hour) and I wished the bread they served was warm (seemed like store bought cold bread). One other little side-note: If you hate seafood, this is probably not the place for you. I am not saying this because the menu has a majority of seafood, as you can still find steaks and other non seafood items, but because upon entering the restaurant, you are instantly greeted with the aroma of fish and other seafood. This could be a bit offputting for some. After a few minutes though, you get used to it if you don't mind the smell of seafood. Some people might not be able to get over it and it could be somewhat unpleasant. Additionally, they do sit you fairly close to other parties so if you don't like other people, you may not be happy with the seating arrangements. Lastly, make sure to make reservations as this place gets packed!\",\n",

She came back and politely told me that the manager said they just can't do a party like that on a weekend. Welp... That's pretty crummy.

I believe you\\'re supposed to have a reservation, but we just walked on in and asked if we could be seated.\\n\\nSeating was a little strange but we got over it. The place is strange in general, so if you\\'re looking for \"normal\" you should probably save this for a later date. We sat in a tiny room with another family on the opposite end. The lighting is very dim and romantic, and the entire feel is very \"couple-sy\", so you should probably steer clear if you\\'re going through a breakup.\\n\\nOur server was a straight up Lobster connoisseur. She broke that puppy into beautiful savory little pieces in seconds flat, leaving us with the shell in tact (probably so that we could revel in how much better she was able to do it than we ever would have been, which we did).\\n\\nWe went all out and had the full course meal, complete with paired glasses of wine. It was quite the pricey treat, but it was worth it.\\n\\nNoteworthy appetizer: The oysters are absolutely heavenly. I have only ever eaten oysters previously at Casey Moores Oyster House, so it was nice to be able to try them somewhere else... but there was no comparison, Salt Cellar\\'s oysters far exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nExpect to pay well over $100 for two, my fellow cheapskates!',\n",

It all looks and feels like the inside of a ship and its surprisingly a very nice feeling.\\n\\nWe had the crab cakes for an appetizer and then the stuffed lobster and the king crab legs.  Everything was very good.  \\n\\nCrab Cakes -\\nThey were great.  Not huge but great.  Almost no breading so tons of crab and a very nice dipping sauce that I can't recall.\\n\\nStuffed Lobster -\\nNicely sized lobster with all of the meat intact (sometimes I feel that places replace some of the meat with the stuffing to use the meat elsewhere).  The stuffing was very good but seemed like a lot of breading.  Very nice dish though.\\n\\nKing Crab Legs -\\nThese were great.  Very fresh.  No saltiness, fishiness, or hint of freezer burn that you get many times with king crab legs.  Quite a nice touch that the waitress cracks all of the shells for you tableside and even leaves all the kunckle meat easily accessible.  All the legs were an ok size but not huge.  They were cooked perfectly though.\\n\\nOverall I would say great seafood and a menu with tons of variety and fresh items.  It was a little over priced though.  Pretty much every dish was at least $30 and most were high $30s.  Not obnoxiously expensive but a little much.\",\n",

I was very excited since I previewed the menu online and other's I had spoken with about the restaurant seemed to be satisfied customers.\\n\\nThe service was great. The wait staff was attentive. My friend ordered the Shrimp San Remos (which seems to be a hit with others that have written a review) for the both of us. It was great.\\n\\nMy friend ordered a lobster and I ordered a stuffed (crab & scallops) lobster. Her lobster was fine. But my lobster had the not so faint smell of ammonia. We even compared lobster smells and she agreed that my dish smelled of ammonia. I didn't say anything to anybody else and I ate most of my meal. It didn't dawn on me until the next day to look online and see why my lobster smelled of ammonia. Well, apparently this is what happens when the lobster isn't frozen or prepared in a timely manner after harvest or death. Although the quality of meat has deteriorated, it doesn't necessarily mean you will get food poisoning. Which I did not thankfully. Anyway, it was more disappointing than anything since it was my first time there and I expected a little bit better fare. \\n\\nI probably set myself up for failure since it was the middle of the week, an hour and a half before closing and people were just trying to go home. I thought they dealt with fresh seafood... Anyway, just a disappointment.\\n\\nNext time it will be an easier decision with Pappadeux's right around the corner from me.\",\n",

They did what they had to do to get fresh lobster to the restaurant the day I showed up to eat it. You do pay for that kind of freshness of course, but please believe me - this is ALWAYS better than eating rubbery, whiffy lobster.

The bread was delicious, especially when we dipped it in the sauce from our SHRIMP SAN REMO APPETIZER which tasted like nothing I ever had before and was one of the best tasting dishes I have ever had.  I will definitely order that again.\\nI had the BLACKENED HALIBUT which was the biggest piece I have ever been served in my life and it was cooked perfecly and the tasted delicious.  The baked potato was also very good.  The BROCOLLI with a touch of cheese sauce was amazing!  My daughter had the KING CRAB LEGs which were cracked open tableside by the waitress.  My daughter said some of the pieces were really good and some were just ok.  For $55 I expected them to all be delicious.  I enjoyed the bite I tried, which was very lobster like to me.   My husband had the SAUTEED SCALLOPS with mushrooms which was absolutely DELICIOUS.  \\n\\nOUR DESSERT was the BOURBON CHEESECAKE which the server gave to us on the house since it was our anniversary.  Nice touch.  It was delicious!\\n\\nWe are all looking forward to going back and trying more entrees and we will definitely order the SHRIMP SAN REMO again if it's available!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I hate to give such an iconic restaurant as The Salt Cellar 3 stars but I think I have too.. I'm basing this on the main entrees and pricing. The appetizers were delicious and the service was exceptional. That could have been due to the fact that the place was pretty dead for a Friday night.. But nevertheless our server, I think her name was Destiny(?) She was very very good and recommended we try the Sauteed shrimp San Remo, SO GOOD!. We also got a bucket of steamed clams and some calamari. \\nMy main issue was with the average tasting, overly priced entrees. My food was tasty, I got the Scallops with King crab & Atlantic Baby Shrimp sauce. Our server gave an excellent description of what to expect when the food came and I'm glad she did because what I got was not what I expected, but like I said, it was OK. My boyfriend and his sister were not particularly please with their entree choices either. \\nI think the moral of the story is, unless you have a TON of money to drop on lobster (I'm guessing that's what they're known for) just go to enjoy the ambiance, have some wine and appetizers. You will still have a pretty heavy ticket at the end of the night but it will be a much better experience.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I have been to the Salt Cellar a few times before for happy hour but decided to come in for a nice sit down dinner with a friend and have the full experience. \\n\\nWhen we walked down the stairs we were immediately greeted by the hostess who was very nice . Since we were a little early for our reservation, she suggested that we sit at the bar for a cocktail and appetizer since it was still happy hour. \\n\\nOur cocktail server was very polite and promptly took our drink orders.  We decided to have the oysters on the half shell which were just delicious.  We sat at the bar with our drinks and appetizer for about 30 minutes when our server introduced herself and showed us to our table. We were able to transfer our tab from the bar to our table. We of course tipped our cocktail server because she took such good care of us.\\n\\nOnce at our table, our server went over the menu. We decided to order a bottle of wine because we were there for the whole experience.  She brought us and poured our wine and preceeded to tell us about the menu. One of the appetizers on the menu I have never tried before so we decided to order it. The oysters rockefeller,  oh my goodness, it was heaven in my mouth. I would go back just to eat 3 or 4 orders of it for dinner! I finally decided on having the stuffed crab for dinner.  My friend chose the scallops (which I have had before and they melt in your mouth). \\n\\nLet me tell you about the lobster I had. It was stuffed with crab meat and scallops and I couldn't get enough of it! It was so good! Our server took the time to crack  the claws and I'm so glad she did because the meat inside of those claws was phenomenal.  It was fresh and cooked to perfection.\\n\\nAfter the amazing dinner we had just experienced, our server asked if we were ready for desert. Now, I couldn't eat one more bite because I had consumed about 2 pounds of amazing, fresh and perfectly cooked food. She suggested after dinner drinks. Heck yeah! More drinks? Why not? So she and another server suggested a drink called Nuts and Berries. My friend and I decided that we would have that. Holy cow! It was probably the most amazing after dinner drink I ever had! I would love to know how you make it. \\n\\nAll in all i recommend this place to everyone. Between the fresh food, the intimate atmosphere and the wonderful and caring staff, I will definitely be back. The happy hour is amazing, the service is amazing and the food is amazing. Thank you Salt Cellar for an wonderful dining experience! I'll be back :)\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This was such a great meal! I went with my best friend who also loves seafood. We had the half dozen oysters on the half shell and the turtle soup to start. The raw oysters are an old favorite, while the turtle soup is definitely a new one. It was served with a slice of lime and a shot of cooking sherry to be added to taste. The mixed basket of bread on the table was perfect for dipping into the dark flavorful soup (my favorite was the olive bread), and the soup was gone quickly. The turtle meat had been completely removed from the turtle and shredded. It had the consistency of shredded pork, but just a little different. If you've never had it, I highly recommend trying it.  Not only because it's delicious, but because it's always good to step out of your food comfort zone, especially for something so tasty. I promise you will be licking the little bits of turtle meat off of the spoon :-)\\n For the main courses we ordered the swordfish with mango salsa and the pound and a half of king crab legs. The mango salsa was a great contrast to the seared swordfish. It was also perfectly cooked and not too dry, which, in my limited experience, seems to be difficult with swordfish.  The swordfish also came with a salad, steamed veggies and either a baked potato or rice.  Now to finish this off with the best part: the crab legs were amazing! The server asked us if we wanted him to crack them and after saying yes, he dazzled us with his wicked awesome crab leg cracking skills. Every piece was ready to be eaten, and only very little use of the very small fork given, was needed.  On a side note, king crab is the way to go if you have the choice. the smaller opilio crab doesn't ever really give you a good sized bite of crab, but king crab is all big juicy bites of meaty crab goodness. \\nThe Salt Cellar was a dimly lit cozy environment.  The walk down the stairs into the cellar should have been a warning that we were going to have to climb out of there, which may have limited out excessive food intake :-) there was a cocktail lounge if you just want to have a beverage, and two dining rooms which have great beach and ocean landscape pictures on the walls.  The staff was very friendly, and so were the live lobsters in the giant tank as you walk in. This is a great place to take a friend or a rather impressive place for a first date.  Just make sure that he/she likes seafood.\",\n",

And what???? no elevator ??? to go down into this underground establishment??? they had handicap parking, but no handicap access !! Isn 't that a law ? ADA? They kindly offered two strong young men to help haul em up...  We were all shaken up and worried by the time we sat down, how the hell were we going to get up those stairs?  My Dad was looking forward to King Crab Legs... they were $50! He went for a steak. We all ordered oysters, and in two dozen got 3 bad ones. ugh! ever had a bad oyster? It's almost enough to cure you... I know, what do you expect in the desert when ordering seafood??  I don't know... Maybe a fair price for fresh food??? The service was very good, the food was bad or blah, the price was RIDICULOUS for a three hundred dollar anniversary dinner, I felt robbed.\",\n",

It is not handicap accessible. No ramps or elevators which they state on their website due to the building's structure. We went for happy hour followed by dinner. The happy hour bar is small and dark. It wasn't as cool down there as I expected. The bar areas were warm. I asked to have the ceiling fans turned on only to be informed that they would pull more warm air down. The restaurant section was very well cooled. The bar was very crowded. We sat at the bar as you enter the restaurant. Both had happy hour. The hostess and servers were friendly and helpful. If you go for happy hour be there when the doors open for a good seat. We enjoyed our bar appetizers more than our meals. The shrimp toast was tasty. The crab cakes were excellent. I would go back for them. My husband said he enjoyed his bucket of clams. The Georges Bank scallops were okay. I think they needed more flavor. My husband had the blackened halibut. I had grouper. Neither of us were overly impressed with our dinner entrees. The salad was delicious. There were pros and cons. Considering the prices we expected more flavorful, memorable food and stronger cocktails. It's something different that we are glad to say we tried. I would definitely go back for the crab cakes and maybe to try their lobster.\",\n",

My husband made reservations for us online for dinner,for my birthday. Online they ask my husband if we where celebrating any special occasion, my husband told them that we where celebrating my birthday. During our entire dining experience they made NO mention of my birthday to us. (Why even ask the question when we made the reservation)!!!   Our table was so small &  cramped,  to the point that we could hear everything the table next to us was talking about!  There was a candle on our table but I couldn't hear any music which really took a lot from the experience!! not romantic at all. I had a $40 entry (blackened halibut), which is my favorite fish. I was so disappointed  it was very dry &  certainly not a at  $40 entry. My husband had the salmon which had little flavor.   However our crab cakes (appetizer) was great. OuR server walked by our table 2 times, finally on the 3rd trip by,  he finally  offered to pick up our plates!!!  This was our first visit and last. Our dining experience was certainly not a good value ($160 which included  gratuity) wow!!\",\n",

I thought maybe we went in the wrong door(?), but no, we did not. It's a pretty small place, especially this one corner where we got sat. I almost felt like the building was not in code (my interior design side steppn' out), because it was not handi-cap friendly (all stairs) and it was pretty tight spaced. Eh.\\n\\nI had the stuffed trout (Idaho) with rice pilaf and veggies. Kris had the grilled trout, 7 oz. steak, and veggies. Apparantly we agreed that my stuffed trout was better. Be warned, girly drinks here are $14, YES, $14 a piece. I ordered the Creamsicle and Fuzzy Navel- $28 out the door. Ouch. Bill was $106+Tax.

       "  'text': 'When we got there 20 minutes early and found there was no parking, I had to drive around the block to look for an available spot on the street.     When I mentioned this to the receptionist, I was informed, by a snotty know-it-all receptionist with non-existent customer service \"skills\" that there was \"plenty\" of parking in the lot, on the side, in the back....   We considered leaving right then and there, and wish we had.  People like this DO NOT belong as a first impression representative.  STRIKE 1\\n\\nHowever, I\\'ve wanted to try this place for some time so we stayed.   We were given an abundance of bread and it did not take long to figure out why.  They fill you up with bread, so that you won\\'t notice the \"couldn\\'t care less\" waiters, forthcoming small portions and terrible food.\\n\\nI ordered the Beef Wellington.  It was small, raw and tasteless.   I did not know it was possible to make a bad Beef Wellington, but the Salt Cellars have this failure down to perfection.  STRIKE 2\\n\\nI asked for blue cheese, and the waiter told me they did not have blue cheese, but a tarragon dressing that was close to blue cheese.  I decided to try that dressing since I was given no other options.   The dressing was ok, but I would not order it again and while I was eating my salad, the table next to us was ordering and, unlike with us, the same waiter explained each and every salad dressing choice on the list, which including Roquefort.   I love Roquefort.   And for this waiter to suggest tarragon as a close replacement for blue cheese when Roquefort is available, tells me that the waiter doesn\\'t even have a clue about the food he\\'s suggesting. STRIKE 3\\n\\nMy wife had the small lobster tail and something that resembled a filet mignon.   The lobster was very chewy and rubbery with no flavor.  The filet was something totally different and unacceptable.  It was flavorless, and so tough you could have used it for shoe leather.   I have no idea how anyone could do this to a \"filet\", unless, as I suspect, it wasn\\'t even a filet to begin with.   She brought it home, and attempted to finish it today, but could only saw through a couple of bites.  The remaining carcass was disposed of in the trash where it belongs.   STRIKE 4\\n\\nWhile the inconsiderate waiter showed the desert tray to everyone else, he simply brought our bill.  We both though this was incredibly rude and don\\'t understand the reason for the crappy service and attitudes and total and complete lack of understanding of items the restaurant has to offer.  STRIKE 5\\n\\nI can\\'t understand why the Salt Cellar is even in business.  The snotty staff has a totally unacceptable attitude towards its customers.  Our waiter knew about all the available salad dressings, but only recommended one and did not even bother with the desert tray.  The food was worse than TERRIBLE.  There was not one good memorable thing about our \"experience\" with the Salt Celler that would bring us back to this disaster.   Everything about this place IS ABSOLUTLY TERRIBLE!',\n",

       "  'text': 'My GF and I went to dine here prior to attending Hamilton at Gammage.  I completely spaced that it was a Friday night, because I had intended us to dine at a certain Oyster House in Tempe, and so forgot to make a reservation.  I had not been to the Salt Cellar in over 30 years, back in high school, for a prom or such.  My friend at work reminded me of it, and I am glad he did.\\n\\nWe put our name on the list, but also got lucky and found 2 seats at the end of the bar.  Extremely lucky, because it only continued to fill up, which we learned is only a testament to the continued popularity of this underground valley landmark.\\n\\nUnlike another recent reviewer, we ate at the bar.  However, we did order off the Happy Hour menu, so maybe that might be why?  Not sure, but we are returning there in a couple weeks, so I will inquire and follow up.\\n\\nWe ordered the Oysters on the half shell, Bucket of steamed Mussels, and fresh bread from the HH menu, and also the signature dish, Sauteed Shrimp San Remo from the \"Seasonal Bar Appetizers\" menu.  Strange menu name for a place you supposedly can\\'t eat at the bar at?  Again, maybe you can\\'t order from the standard menu.\\n\\nThe Oysters and Mussels were surprisingly larger than we expected!!  My GF remarked on this, as she is a much more experienced seafood aficionado than I.  The bucket of mussels was very generously sized, so I felt a lot better about the $13 price.  The $2 each oyster price, easily justified by their size. The bread was OK.  The Shrimp San Remo, I thought at the time was great, especially for dunking the remaining mussels and bread in, but my GF told me later she wasn\\'t that impressed with it.  Worth giving a try to decide for yourself.  Definitely rich though, lots of butter and oil.\\n\\nDrinks were good, service was good, staff attitudes very welcoming, and the ambiance was very nice.  Bartender (1 of 3) was busy, but very professional and responsive.\\n\\nAs I stated, we plan on returning.  I am looking forward to trying some new dishes including the Oyster Rockefeller.  We both remarked that it seemed like there were a LOT of regulars in attendance too, so make of that what you will.  How did we know?  Try becoming a regular somewhere and you will learn how to spot them too.\\n\\nWord of advice - if you want to impress your date and definitely have access to the full menu . . . make a reservation!!  Fortunately, I have the world\\'s most awesome GF, so she only teased me for a short time about my failure to do so.  However, I suspect that the fact that we left there happily stuffed probably contributed to that leniency too . . . Nah!!!! She\\'s just awesome!!  ;-)',\n",

My son had a baked lobster and was very pleased as well. The restaurant is underground with comfortable seating, nice decor, and a casual upscale vibe.

       "  'text': 'Adorable, intimate ambience- check! Absolutely superb, attentive service-check! Out of this world seafood- che.....errr, sorry Salt Cellar, as much as I wanted to love and was excited to try you, you left some to be desired.\\n\\nAt the suggestions of many close friends whose taste i\\'m usually aligned with, I decided this would be my \"special occassion\" pick for my bf\\'s bday. The allure of this place is certainly that its uniquely underground and not a chain. You feel as if you are going on a fun, mini trek while heading downstairs to the dining area. Certainly had no probs with the past reviewers comments on noise levels or stuffy air. Salt Cellar is quite small, with limited, close-together seating and a surprisingly stocked bar which houses a great Happy hr I hear. I would suggest asking for a reservation on the \"raised\" corner booths if I were to return.\\n\\nThe hostess was extremely helpful when I snuck away to order my bf a complimentary bday dessert (you can choose any of the menus offerings) and our waitress was one of the best servers I\\'ve had in a long time. Not only did she help us by extensively describing dishes, but she continually checked up on us. We were shocked at the cheap prices of the wine-by-the glasses, yet it all made sense when she brought over some of the smallest glasses that should be allowed to be qualified as wine glases. \\n\\nEntrees are served with bread, a dinner salad and veggies, and our main course came out lightning fast (is this always a good thing? i think not) I went with the Australian Barramundi w/ Spicy Avocado Vinaigrette ($35), a white fish the waitress desc. as similar to a halibut. And I gotta say, I thought the point of paying extra $ in AZ for seafood was bc its flown in fresh weekly....but holy moly fishy flavor. I wouldn\\'t regard this as a great catch. We were told diners always had a prob with the oily vinaigrette that would separate atop the fish, so they began serving it on the side. This sauce is quite a strong, but good flavor.\\n\\nMy bf ordered one of the more pricier dishes on the menu - Baked Stuffed Lobster. The stuffing of scallops and crabmeat was ehhh and the overall size of this meal was lacking (altho. we couldve upgraded). The one thing I liked was that you could add an affordable side-order of King Crab Legs to any meal...This dish was certainly better than the Barramundi.\\n\\nLastly, our flourless choco cake was below par. The consistency almost was as if it was undercooked, and needed a fruit or raspberry sauce to offset its taste. I am curious to try their Kahlua topped, Banana gelato wafer...\\n\\nOverall, I did enjoy my experience here. Will I be comin back for more and ravin to all my friends about it? Naw. But I can\\'t hate on you Salt Celler, afterall, we are in AZ :)',\n",

HORRIBLE service, she should not be working at this type of Restaurant. This place is pretty high class, good quality type seafood joint and you pay a pretty good amount for any entree you get. Normally when you get seated the cocktail waitress will ask if you need anything to drink...we had no one for 15 minutes even say a word to us after we were sat. Our server comes over and finally takes our order and the food comes out wrong for two of the people. Dore says you can just switch your sides and it will be okay and then walks away. We all just looked at each other and Dore walks away. She knew bringing the food out the entrees were not correct so 1st...why did she bring them out incorrect and not have them fixed 2nd...in a restaurant where you are paying $35-$55 an entree you do not tell a customer to switch sides and food.  NO, our entress never got corrected, we just ate what we had and made it work. It gets even better, we wanted to see the small menu that had the deserrt coffees and drinks in it. Dore tell us we dont really have one and i say to her yes you do we had it when we sat down. Doesnt bring it to us, just lists them off, so i go and get up to get the menu myself. There were a ton of smallet things that happened throughout our dinner experience that were very unecessary. Im not sure i will be back or bring anyone here for sometime. The place was not busy by any means, as we got there before the late night dinner rush. Christmas Eve nightmare dinner :/',\n",

We sat at the bar and had some kind of overpriced shrimp and mushrooms served in a strange sauce.  It was not what I was expecting.  I ordered a beer and the bartender seemed nice enough, but he also seemed like he was burned out after working behind that particular bar for what must be 20 years.  The beer was served in a bottle and, as usual, overpriced.  A glance at the menu revealed some VERY expensive dinners.  I was SHOCKED to see that these prices were twice what Carlsbad Tavern or Richardson\\'s was.   However, it was kind of neat to see this one \"old school\" patron choose his LOBSTER out of the tank.  The timid hostess grabbed the LOBSTER with a net and scurried back the the kitchen was a look of \"ewwww\" on her face.   So, on a 10 scale, this place was about a 7 when I was hoping for a 9.  At least the atmosphere was good and the smell was nice.  :)',\n",

This place is all about the ambiance only if you survive the walk down the 120 degree cedar staircase. \\n\\nFirst, if one calls for reservations and one specifies that they have more than one child in the group one would that the first thing out of the hostesses mouth would be a polite warning about the non-kid friendly atmosphere solely for the discretion of the reserver. But NNNOOOOOO way...this  greedy establishment wants any dollar they can get since the quality is not worthy. \\n\\nNo high chairs, no kids cups, nothing in plastic, or paper to go bowls, no kids menus.

Sad indeed for a seafood restaurant that should be better than the rest.  \\n\\nThe filet was ordered medium but cooked all the way through since the chef opted to butterfly it to save time in hopes of rushing to the next customer and the pressing it to the grill ensured that there was no juices remaining and the char from the grill was the only flavor disguised as steak rub. \\n\\nMy recommendation...dead lobster for seafood and outback for steak and you would be a happier customer than of you dined at this anti-child establishment.',\n",

       "  'text': 'OK, went here because a gal I work with says it is her favorite place in Scottsdale and I got a Groupon sooo...\\n\\nI actually loved the atmosphere, as other posters state it is underground and dated.  Which, being from the Midwest, reminded me of the \"supper Clubs\" we used to go to with my parents (Midwesterners, you know what I\\'m talking about).  Dark-ish, cozy, unusual seating patterns.\\n\\nFor those complaining about the price, they must still be thinnking in Midwestern terms because $39 for a lobster in Scottsdale is not overpriced (anywhere else yes, but Scottsdale seems to jack up the price on everything).\\n\\nOK, onto the food, we started with cocktails in the bar which were just meh... average.  We got in late but the place was still hopping even on a Thursday night.  Skipped the apps and went straight for the entrees.  Again reminded of a supper club in that you didn\\'t have to order everything ala carte.  All entrees came with salad, vegetable and starch - nice!  I ordered the Halibut cheeks with lemon caper sauce and Hubs ordered the Shrimp Scampi with extra garlic.  I could smell his dish being cooked before it was brought to the table, but he claims he couldn\\'t taste the garlic (he is kind of a garlic freak, so a normal person would have said it was loaded).  Cooked nicely with lots of shrimp but nothing special.  The shrimp toast that came with it however was awesome!  I would have ordered this as an entree.  My halibut cheeks were good if a little on the tough side, not so bad but just a little.  They were breaded and pan fried and served with Lemon and capers which was yummy.  Here\\'s the kicker, they gave my like 10 cheeks!  That\\'s alot of Halibut cheeks, normally you\\'d get like 3-4.  So I took a bunch home and made luxurious fish tacos with the leftovers.\\n\\nSo overall a nice experience, good seafood especially for Scottsdale where it is actually hard to find really good food in general, especially hard to find good seafood.  It\\'s no San Francisco or Seattle or Boston, but I would go back and try again.',\n",

I would definitely recommend it based on it's historical significance; however, if you're looking for great all-around seafood experience, you may want to consider some of the other notable seafood restaurants around the valley.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is cool - in that, the dining area is located underground, making it dimly lit, and the theme is old nautical.  (Although, I did feel slightly claustrophobic once we were seated and had to quickly down some wine to relax that panic.)  The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and we didn't really have to wait long to be served our drinks or meals.\\n\\nWe ordered the Monk Fish, Crab Cakes, Baked-Stuffed Lobster, and the Salmon.

Not that this is a bad thing - I guess I have just become more comfortable with seafood dishes that have something extra regarding flavor.\\n\\nI'm glad that I had the experience - hopefully the Salt Cellar has another 30 years left in it, but if I have the taste for seafood again I probably won't go back.\",\n",

We arrived not realizing we should have made reservations, so we ended up waiting for an hour; not a big deal. We spent that hour at the bar where the bartenders were very efficient. We tried the scallops as appetizers which were very good. \\n\\nWe were then seated and greeted by our server quickly. I mentioned my food allergies and the server was very accommodating. I enjoyed the Alaskan Halibut and my wife enjoyed the King Salmon Oscar she ordered. both were cooked excellently.\\n\\nMy only minor complaints are that it was a bit noisy as it is a \"cellar\" type room, very enclosed. The pricing was a bit high as well, but we really enjoyed our meals so it wasn\\'t a big deal. We would definitely return.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Yum! Can't wait to return for a full-blown dinner here.\\n\\nCame here for impromptu apps/drinks this past Sunday and was very impressed.\\n\\nNot only is the location and ambience unlike ANYTHING you'll find in Phoenix, the food was pretty amazing as well. Are you in the cabin of a fisherman's boat in the middle of the Pacific? Are you in the Arizona desert? You'll never know the difference here.\\n\\nWe pulled up a seat at the bar and ordered a dozen oysters, shrimp cocktail, and fish tacos. \\n\\nLet me first say that the oysters were HUGE (see pics). The biggest I've ever seen - this might be the first time in my life that I've been full from oysters..the largest shells were the size of my entire palm! I asked one of the bartenders where they came from and he said Chesapeake Bay since the gulf of Cali doesn't produce the best oysters. I found it surprising they were all the way from the East Coast.. they were very fresh.\\n\\nSensing a theme here,the cocktail shrimp were also ginormous and super tasty. Cocktail sauce (has some kick!) tasted homemade, and didn't seem like it came out of a plastic tub.\\n\\nShrimp/fish tacos were very yummy. They definitely didn't skimp on the portions when they stuffed the tacos and the sauce + coleslaw also had some spicy kick!\\n\\nTo finish, we ordered the Banana Foster. HOLY COW. It was gone in maybe 3 minutes flat. I'd go back just for that.\\n\\nWhile this is an upscale restaurant, don't expect to find the nicest of nice things here. The restaurant has been open since the late 70's/early 80's and not much renovation has happened since as evident through the bar cabinets, furniture, etc. I did find it oddly charming the super skinny door entrances (you really feel like you're on a boat!) and that there were high tank toilets with a chain in the bathrooms. \\n\\nWe will be back soon! :)\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Whoaaaa, I can\\'t believe I haven\\'t reviewed Salt Cellar yet! Well, let me rectify that immediately!\\n\\nBACKGROUND \\n\\nI remember when the Salt Cellar was THE place to go for dinner when you had a date.\\n\\nAlthough there are now all sorts of nouveaux chic pop-ups that are stealing the limelight, Salt Cellar maintains itself as a decent place to get some tasty seafood.\\n\\nSALT CELLAR\\n\\nSalt Cellar was established in 1971, and continues to reign atop the \"Best Of Seafood\" lists. \\n\\nOwners Richard and Cindy Huie follow the business philosophy that consistency, quality, equitable pricing and great service are the key to success.\\n\\nThe culinary adventure begins with its unique underground location. \\n\\nOne peek through the ground-level skylight reveals a world far removed from the desert; take the antique wooden stairway down 3 flights and you will find yourself transported to a snug seaside hideaway.\\n\\nSalt Cellar\\'s fresh fish and seafood selections will take you around the world; from Hawaii, Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, Boston, Georges Bank and even New Zealand. \\n\\nThe Salt Cellar is known for always having available a selection of whole Maine lobster; 1lb, 3lb, and 5lb. \\n\\nThe extensive menu abounds with choices that will surely satisfy every craving.  \\n\\nIn addition to the year-round and seasonal fresh fish, the Salt Cellar serves choice Black Angus steaks, a chicken entrée and even beef Wellington.\\n\\nTHE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE \\n\\nAs I mentioned, I\\'ve been going to Salt Cellar for years.\\n\\nOn our last couple occasions, we went for family birthday gatherings. Their dining room is PERFECT for a bigger, yet intimate, setting.\\n\\nI had the oysters on the half, which were large in cup size AND meat size, and DELICIOUS. I also had the fresh mussels in drawn butter broth, which were FANTASTIC. \\n\\nI get the fresh lobster every time.\\n\\nThey have the fresh lobsters in a tank, so you can actually see what you\\'re getting.\\n\\nI even indulged in one of their specialty dessert cakes, which I didn\\'t share with anyone, even though they offered several forks.\\n\\nI had them make me a tasty girly drink of amaretto, orange juice, grenadine, and a ton of cherries.\\n\\nThe service is usually exceptional, although Tim got a little snippy at the end, making comments about who he had to listen to, and who was \"paying the bill.\" Ohhh Tim, big faux pas to discuss the bill AND insult the restaurant picker of the family, but whatever, I\\'m obnoxious, so I\\'ll take the blame ;)\\n\\nCONCLUSION \\n\\nSalt Cellar is an oldie but goodie. I\\'m still a fan and will keep coming back.\\n\\n4/5 RECOMMEND \\n\\n*Plenty of parking out front.\\n\\n*Difficult stairway for some to manage.\\n\\n*For more information: saltcellarrestaurant.com',\n",

This place is so charming, I love how its entry door is a little shack, and leaves one with woderment of what is to come once you walk in, and down the staircase.  The lighting is slightly dim, giving way to a great spot for a romantic date, or just an elegant touch to any dining experience.  The seafood is amazing quality, fresh, and although a bit pricey, its worth it as AZ doesn't have an ocean, so save a little to enjoy the dishes here.  My favorite is the salmon wellington, and don't forget about the escargot!  By far the best seafood offerings in Arizona, in my opinion.  When its hot out in the middle of the summer, hide in the Salt Cellar, where its cool and charming.  Its a great place to go to all year long, especially great for birthdays/anniversaries.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My boyfriend and I went here for happy hour and dinner before a play on Friday night. I love that they are underground. It does add a romantic feel to the place. \\n\\nWe started with a couple of oyster shots and stuffed baked clams in the bar. The oysters and clams are $1.50 each during HH and the stuffed baked clams were $1.75 each. The stuffed clams were large and yummy. The shooters were good too but they came with a lot of sauce. They have a cute bar so I can see myself coming here for HH again. My one complaint is that I ordered the stuffed clams when we were in the bar having drinks and they were taking quite some time. While we were waiting the hostess came and got us because our table was ready and told us that they would bring the clams when they were ready to our table. Well we were seated, ordered and got our salads and still no stuffed clams (which I paid for at the bar, they made sure I closed out before I was seated). We notified our waitress and she said that no one had told her anything. She checked and then came back and said they had put in a wrong order and they were just baking. I understand places make mistakes but once someone has been waiting at least 25-30 minutes for something that should have taken 10 at the max, then comp the item or offer a comped dessert. We got neither. \\n\\nAnyway dinner was good. Their salad had a bit too much of the vinaigrette. I had the stuffed lobster and it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the petite fillet and said it was cooked perfectly but lacked flavor. I'd still give this place another try.\",\n",

I have been there during the week, on the weekends, early evening, late night it doesn\\'t matter the service is always superb and the food delicious.\\nI found one of reviews about the steaks absurd. If you go to a seafood place and expect to get an inch and a half steak. Why not ask the server \"are your steaks thick\"? Why would you assume that a great seafood restaurant has equally great steaks? \\nI will advise that if you want to get in to this restaurant for dinner, make a reservation. There aren\\'t a lot of tables and its very busy. Again, I have never had a meal at the salt cellar that wasn\\'t delicious.

       "  'text': 'Have you ever been to a place so fancy, that your first thought before you did anything was \"Will this make me look like an uncultured swine?\"\\n\\nArriving early for happy hour, before my daughter\\'s birthday dinner, we make our way up to the bar, as the first patrons of the day.  The no-nonsense barkeep, whose entertained both debutantes and scofflaws alike since the Johnson administration, greets us and in a gravely voice, asks \"Whaddaya havin\"\\n\\nIn the lowest, manly toned timbre I can muster, I reply \"An iced tea... please\".  Looking into his expressionless eyes, I sensed that my drink order may have  just broken his spirit.\\n\\nHe returns with my frosty beverage, and a basket of sourdough bread.\\n\\nSourdough bread... it\\'s the rich man\\'s \"funnel cake\".\\n\\nA few minutes later, as we were seated next to Arizona\\'s retired elite, who were downing vermouth and olive juice, scoffing at Ketel One, I noticed a plate of olive oil resting on the far side of the bar (see photo), I proceed to dip my bread... and then notice the viscosity is nothing like I\\'ve ever noticed before with EVOO.\\n\\nThe plate of \"coarse salt\" to its left should have been a clue.  Nothing quite says \"you dont belong\", like dipping your sourdough bread in the margarita lime juice.\\n\\nNeeding to salvage dignity, I quickly order the shrimp san remo and fish & chips appetizers... and hoped no one was the wiser.  I couldn\\'t try the shellfish dish, but it was probably my daughter\\'s favorite dish of the evening.  My F&C looked like big puffy cod beignets, and were delicious with their light batter.\\n\\nOur waitress then whisked us away to our white linen-ed table, where another full basket of bread was awaiting our arrival.  My daughter commented the feel of the room would go well with Disney\\'s Pirates attraction.  After taking our orders, the waiter brings a tiny chaffing glass of yellowish liquid suspended over a candle flame.  I just assumed this was a heated bouquet of fragrance, being too intimidated to inquire\\n\\nMy daughter ordered her first lobster, and I, my first wellington.  Both of our assessments were exactly the same.  I\\'m glad I tried it, and I dont feel the need to order it again... ever\\n\\nIn time, my curiosity got the best of me, and I inquired as to the canary colored solvent.  It was clarified butter.  Hmm, what exactly can I do with this clear elixir?  It wasn\\'t simply put there for the fragrance.  As the uncultured swine that I am, I proceeded to Google \"clarified butter\", to better understand these fancy-man ways.\\n\\nGhee, from the hills of India, which contains some unsubstantiated weight loss properties... so I immediately tossed it back... much like the two ladies with their vermouth and olive juice.\\n\\nA fun time was had by both father and daughter, as we bantered back and forth about our misgivings with the dessert menu, as \"funnel cake\" was noticeably absent\\n\\nAs we ascended the staircase back up to our awaiting vehicle,  we are instantly transported back from 1800\\'s Spanish galleon to modern day, 104 degree phoenix... while that old, retired lady who was sitting next to you at the bar... you know, the one who had one too many vermouth and olive juices, looks back at you and says \"hey, yous can go around me... its gonna take a while\"\\n\\n\"Gladly, madame... gladly\"',\n",

The clam chowder (not the manhattan kind cuz that just isn't real clam chowder and I can say that since I'm from Massachusetts) is very good, creamy just like I like it.  The escargot in mushroom caps is good, but I'd rather just have the escargot in garlic butter and do without the mushroom caps (they blocked the true flavors of the dish).  The ceviche was very good and the oysters were good too.  Ambience wise, it is pretty dark overall (well, maybe that is because it is underground).  The bar is cold in both its temperature and its design.  The dining room looks dated.  Overall, if you are going for quality seafood and not ambience, it's a winner!\",\n",

They explained it often happens and the rsvps thru OT were for a restaurant in Minnesota! What?!!! They were so very kind to squeeze us in on the spot and find a table for two. This place never disappoints! Our waitress, Toni, was so wonderful; knew the menu by heart and recommended dishes that were very tasty! We each had a glass of wine red / white- Row 11 Pinot noir and can\\'t remember the Chardonnay I had :(- buttery / oaky flavored- so yum! For appetizers, we ordered 1/2 and 1/2 clams & mussels w/ broth & butter dips, that were very good. Our favorite were the mussels. Was served w/ delicious bread and butter. For our entrées, I had the petite fillet, medium, with baked potato and steamed mixed veggies, which also came w/ a house salad. Hubby ordered the Halibut w/ the same sides. Not enough room for dessert, but able to squeeze in a decaf coffee. :) perfect night!\\n\\nThe service and food, once again, PHENOMENAL!!! We can\\'t wait for our next visit! Thanks, Toni, you were awesome!!!',\n",

We had a reservation, so they knew we were coming but once we were seated they acted like were were invisible.  We had to ask for water, which  at the onset sets the tone for what is ahead, and is very off putting.  They had plenty of waitstaff so we couldn't understand what the problem was.  You hardly saw the same person twice.  Finally the waiter came and he could tell I personally was annoyed.  He tried to step it up for the rest of the meal and it did work out.  At these prices, no one should have to wait 15 minutes for water and have to ask for it.\\n\\nBut I will give them 4 stars. But again only based on the quality of the food.  Interesting ambiance.

Do NOT bother to order anything that is not prepared as steamed or boiled.  We started with steamed clams and the waiter, when he placed them in front of us, informed us that it came with two dipping sauces.  I'm like...WHAT?  The broth is for cleaning the clam of an final sand particles before you dredge through butter.  Whoa. Get a clue.  We ordered our dinner and I specifically said, as my date was getting a stuffed crab, that I was allergic to crab and I am allergic to bell peppers so, with my baked haddock dish, please do not include them with the mixed veggies that come with the plate.  Well...I'm just going to comment on the haddock.  DISGUSTING.  Overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish.  Plopped on top was a GROSS PLOP of praline spread--that was tasteless--that you might find inside a croissant at a bad bakery. The crab was overcooked and tiny and had raw almonds thrown on top of it.  AND my plate arrived steaming with BELL PEPPERS.  As we sent everything back, seriously inedible.  We paid for the clams and got out of there. The rude hostess told my date that I was mistaken about bell peppers being on my plate.  REALLY?  See my photo.  WORST SEA FOOD IN PHOENIX.  I've been here twice. Once about 10 years ago...non memorable.  And then ten years later...still lousy.  Steamed or boiled. Take your pick.  The prices are outrageous for the lack of skill  or refinement that comes out of the kitchen. Also...when a guest says they are allergic to something...GET WITH IT unless you want a lawsuit.\",\n",

We wanted to go to a bit nicer place since it is our Anniversary and were completely disappointed. For the money we spent we could of had bought all that seafood and prepared it better myself and paid for some personal entertainment for the evening. Lessened learned we will not be returning. Unfortunately we had to learn this tasteless lesson on such a special night. I must add before I end that my husband broke out in red spots and fever an hour after eating at The Salt Cellar. I'm most certain this was just a coincidental allergy after talking to a doctor giving him Benadryl. He felt better after taking the medicine but we both grew up on seafood in the Northwest and he has never experienced anything like that after eating seafood. The only dish he ate that I refused to was the steamed muscles because they were so small and over cooked but maybe they were just poor quality. I know I have high standards after just now getting out of the food industry after culinary school and ten years in restaurants, BUT this is the first time I have felt strongly enough to write a yelp review in hopes of warning someone who was also thinking of trying The Salt Cellar for the first time to just not. Maybe if the service was a amazing I would not have been inspired to write my first review but it was just was bad as the food. I just give up. Good seafood does not happen in the desert.

Right now after having dinner and several drinks at their happy hour I'm wishing that our fight would've landed us both incredibly angry at each other so we just went home because I would still have $85 in my pocket and not want to slit my wrist at the meal that I just had. \\n\\nLet's start with oysters... everybody knows if you get an oyster that is at least a pound it's going to taste like everything that it's lived by for the last 37 years... minerals, human garbage, you get the idea. Let's talk about chowder - is that the red or the white? Both types of this classic mirage of seafood deliciousness always bring a smile to my face, but if you're going to serve something that is runny and wishing for more oyster crackers ( basically POW porridge that the Koreans wouldn't even serve ) I eat it so not to offend the nice bartender. \\n\\nNext the crab cakes....or should I say loaf of bread that was soaked in clam juice... But the chef still had the sack to charge 15$. \\n\\nI'll finish with the fish and chips...two decent size pieces of fish cooked relatively well, not too shabby. The texture of the fried fish was a bit soggy ..good color ..but a bit soggy.. The tartar sauce was surprisingly delicious as it made me forget about the sog. But the kicker to this dish was the chips... when you order fish and chips you expect nice potatoes, either in gaufrette form or traditional fries. Here at this particular establishment they served what I would like to call Chinese Stars, a chip so stale that if you threw it across the room you would decapitate seven people..... In short I would like everybody to know that guns don't kill people, Chinese Stars and stale chips do. \\n\\n*disclaimer... Written by my boyfriend.... I'm not that funny\",\n",

       "  'text': \"After hearing mixed reviews from friends and reading mixed reviews on Yelp, I finally decided to give this place a try! We walked in on a Saturday night in October to find they had an hour long wait. The bar was wide open, so we decided to go that route instead. We were informed when we sat down that we could only order appetizers and the bar. This to me was very disappointing. I decided to try and keep an open mind anyway. I ordered the Shrimp San Remo, which came highly recommended on here and thought it was delicious. The sauce was definitely the main attraction. The shrimp were a little on the small side and it only came with six, so I asked if I could get a little side salad of some sorts. Nope, only appetizers at the bar. No salads either. WTH?!?! My boyfriend ordered the mussels appetizer and said they tasted like the mussels you buy at Fry's down the street. So unfortunately, my first experience was not so good. I would be willing to try it again if I am able to order off the full menu. Not being able to order the full menu at the bar when the place isn't that busy is ridiculous in my opinion!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I WISH I COULD GIVE SALT CELLAR ZERO STARS.\\n\\nIf you enjoy being treated as if you are an unworthy piece of crap, you will love Salt Cellar.\\n\\nShort version: \\nWe were asked to leave because we were ordering drinks and appetizers, not entrees. We received horrible treatment from top down: owner, manager and server because we weren\\'t spending enough money... and the money we were spending (probably around  $200+ total) wasn\\'t worthy of a table. Now myself, my family, nor the friends I was with will ever spend another dime in this poor-excuse for a \"service industry\" establishment ever again.\\n\\nDetails:\\nMyself along with four other coworkers came here after work on a Friday to order drinks and food. We all arrived separately between 5-5:30 and put our name in for a table because the bar area did not have enough open seating for us. Two rounds of drinks and about 40 minutes later, we are seated. The waitress offered transfer our bar tab to our new waitress at the table, but we wanted to pay the bartender, to ensure he was getting tipped for his time helping us at the bar.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, we ordered appetizers, and we continued to order drinks.  About 45 minutes in, the server came over and proceeded to say that if we are not ordering dinner, Salt Cellar needs to use the table for people who actually will be ordering dinner. \\n\\nSo, we, paying customers, need to leave our table because we aren\\'t ordering food of a certain price point? Mind you, we weren\\'t just taking up space, we were still ordering food and drink!!!\\n\\nNaturally, our reaction was to question her action. She stood firm. We went to the manager to explain what had just happened. Then, the MANAGER essentially said yeah, if you aren\\'t ordering dinner, we need you to leave the table because there are people waiting to eat dinner. Was extremely rude about it, too. (weird concept, waiting for a table at a restaurant, right?)\\n\\nThat alone made us want to leave, and also made us realize that our waitress was probably told to say that, and it probably wasn\\'t her fault. So on our way out, I apologized to our waitress for the way I reacted. \\n\\nThe owner overheard me apologizing and asked what was going on, and I proceeded to tell him about our experience. To which he, THE OWNER, responded by telling me that I was wrong. Said we couldn\\'t sit at the table if we weren\\'t ordering dinner. He said that we \"misrepresented\" our intentions of what we would be ordering (we never said we wanted dinner) Anyway, I told him that it\\'s wrong to treat customers that way, and he argued me. Told me I was wrong and we need to leave.\\n \\n\\nJust FYI: we are not a rowdy crowd, we were not loud, annoying, inappropriately dressed. We are are all professionals who had just come from the office and wanted to go to (what we thought was) a decent place to enjoy each others company outside of work.',\n",

It is a very dark restaurant, at least the small room we were taken to was.  We used the candle on the table at first to read the menu then gave up and used our phones.  No one offered flashlights or even seemed to notice.  I ordered the swordfish with mango salsa.  The fish tasted fine but there was no imagination in the salsa or the side dishes.  The mango was very tart and overall bland.  My husband had the salmon oscar which is served over bread pudding.  He said the salmon and crab were good enough but again the bread pudding was tasteless and an odd thing to have combined with the seafood.  Salads served with the entree were boring and even the dressing could not help. Our waitress was pleasant enough but seemed to have a superior attitude for some reason.  We were truly disappointed.

We just waited by the bar until they called our name. Happy hour specials are 5-7pm. \\n\\nOysters are $1.50 each and super juicy. My co worker got the shrimp toast and said it was delicious as well. \\n\\nFor my entree I got the house stuffed lobster....SO GOOD!!!! They crack the shell for you at the table so you can get the meat easily. The lobster was stuffed with scallops. $47 but really FRESH!!!!! They light a small candle and place the butter on top.  I think all the entrees come with the house salad- I picked the thousand island dressing- salad was alright. Main attraction is def the seafood!!\\n\\nService is excellent!!! One of the freshest seafood places I have been to in my life.',\n",

The food was good.  My date had the crispy grouper which was really good, and I had swordfish with mango salsa.  For me, the swordfish was good, but I felt like the mango salsa was a bit overwhelming and the entire plate could have used a little more.  We also had a shrimp cocktail appetizer - good - and a chocolate lava cake for dessert - this could have used some ice cream or something, but the waitress actually informed us that they dont have vanilla ice cream at all.  \\nOverall dinner was very nice.

We ordered crab cakes for the appetizer.  In which I love crab however these had no flavor at all I didn\\'t even finish it.  The salads we ok garden salad nothing special.  I did however like the tarragon dressing that was served.  For our Entrees my husband had a baked lobster to which he said was ok.  The Lobster meat was very sweet but again fell flat on the seasonings.  I had the King Crab legs and filet.  I loved the krab leg (just 1) but the steak was terrible so much so that I had it wrapped up to take home for the dogs.  For desert we had the chocolate lava cake.  I don\\'t think it\\'s prepared there seemed pre made.  The sauce was amazing though.  OK.. The service however was AMAZING!!

We arrived for a 7:30 reservation and got seated about 8:20 which was not exactly a good start.  They bought us a complimentary round of drinks which I thought was a nice touch and then when were finally seated, they bought us another round which was very generous.  My initial reaction therefore had mixed feelings.  From that point on the meal was great.  We all ordered fresh fish dishes--Halibut, monkfish, Ahi, and Scallops.  All were cooked perfectly and enjoyed by all.  We shared everything and everyone was quite satisfied.  The service was very good from a waitress named Cara who was knowledgeable and quite personable.  Good experience overall.

To take advantage of the happy hour menu....we had to sit in the bar area. Understood. We ordered food and drinks. I ended up ordering 4 half shell oysters after I tried some of my husbands and really liked them. When the waitress brought them out, one of the oysters was practically non - existent in its shell. We giggled about it and my husband pointed it out to the waitress--being completely friendly. The waitress in turn looked at the plate, said nothing, turned around and walked away and then rolled her eyes! BEYOND rude! Did not acknowledge it at all & was clearly very irritated. My husband then approached the lady at the front to let her know what just happened and how rude she was. She listened, but did absolutely nothing about it. Another waitress helping us (we had 3 waitresses by the way) corrected the situation and brought me another oyster. We wanted to speak to a manager, but found out the lady at the front that my husband spoke to--the one who did not budge when we told her what happened, was the owner's wife! When the rude waitress did what she did, the owner's wife was right next to us because we were sitting at the bar by the door, right by the hostess podium. Clearly, this waitress DID NOT CARE at all! We pretty much came to the conclusion that the rude waitress was a family member of the owners. We spent over $200 for food and drinks between the 4 of us during the not so happy hour yesterday. Needless to say--we will NEVER go to the Salf Cellar again. First and last time. Great oysters...HORRIBLE waitress and an owner who did not do anything about it--fell on deaf ears. It is because the owner failed to be apologetic or even acknowledge that we were mistreated by one of her staff that we will not return. We spent a lot of money here. I will spread the word to everyone too. \\nP.S. The rude waitresses name was Alicia\",\n",

I felt like it was a bunch of college students running around in confusion. Used plates stayed on the table for 45 minutes, silverware was forgotten or not replaced in-between courses, and basic requests kept being missed. \\n\\nIf you are looking for a great place to have happy hour, I highly recommend Salt Cellar but dinner at the cost would probably be better had somewhere else with a higher level of table service.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'First time on a Saturday night and had a delightful experience!  What a fun entrance to descend to the cellar!  We arrived about 45 minutes early and had appetizers and drinks at the bar. Service and the shrimp cocktail were awesome!  The hostess was able to seat us early which was nice, but we were surprised by the small the tables and the close quarters in the small dining area that we were in. I suppose it is a good use of space but be prepared for tight squeeze. It is fine once you get used to it. It didn\\'t bother us much but a group of four came and were really bothered by it and complained but decided to stay. We ordered the New England clam chowder which was the best I\\'ve had in awhile. We planned to get more seafood but when we saw Beef Wellington on the menu we had to get it!  We were not disappointed!  We had the Creme Brûlée for dessert and it was perfectly done!  Overall great experience, prices are high but that is expected since this you\\'re getting fresh seafood in Arizona. It\\'s a landmark, it\\'s been featured on the tv show \"Check Please, Arizona\" with excellent reviews. Highly recommend you try it at least once!',\n",

While the ambiance was nice and the wait staff was efficient, they could not make up for a very high priced Red Lobster type dinner.  After being seated, our first warning was when the waiter mentioned that the salmon and tuna were not wild, but farm raised.  Any restaurant that builds their reputation on seafood, knows to only serve fresh and wild, not farm raised.  My wife who is an unofficial clam chowder aficionado, had a small bowl as an appetizer, and had to send it back.  It was the worst she has ever tasted.  I ordered the crab cakes as the entree expecting them to be fresh and meaty Maryland crab.  Unfortunately, while the crab was large, and the filler kept to a minimum, they had no crab taste, suggesting that they were not fresh crab, but either made from canned crab or imitation crab.  A very disappointing experience.  We will not return. Red Lobster would be a better choice for a better meal and half the price - and we are not Red Lobster fans.  Next time Blue Water Grill or Mastro's Ocean Club.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"The Salt Cellar in Scottsdale, Arizona has been around for over thirty years but after our first (and last) visit I think its time has run out.\\n\\nThe only thing that has changed over the past thirty years are the charges on the wildly over priced  menu.\\n\\nWith $35.95 for a 1 1/4 lb. lobster, almost $39 for Atlantic Halibut and $34 for crab cakes, we expected superlative food. Instead we received dishes that ranged from OK to awful. \\n\\nWe started with Escargot on mushroom caps in garlic butter and New England clam chowder.  The clam chowder was a thin bland soup with a goodly supply of clams. The Escargot was chewy in a butter sauce with just a hint of garlic.  \\n\\nMy Atlantic Halibut was fishy, dry and hard. After confirming my opinion with my table mates I sent it back. Overcooking Escargot and Halibut at a seafood restaurant should be considered fatal errors. My wife and granddaughter had Crab Cakes and Scallops which they judged just OK. Not good enough for almost $80.00 in (2) entrees. To the restaurant's credit, the Halibut was taken off my bill without asking. \\n\\nThe restaurant is literally in a cellar. As the air conditioner cycles, the environment alternates between clammy and freezing.  \\n\\nWe had a cocktail waitress (I haven't seen one of those in many years) which is code for over-priced soft drinks in a small glass with no refills. \\n\\nThe Food Network has a show, Restaurant Impossible, in which the host,  Robert Irvine, visits failing restaurants and fixes their problems. If he visits the Salt Cellar his first stop should be the kitchen.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I started going to Salt Cellar years about ten years ago. It has been my favorite restaurant in Arizona. It is disappointing to see all of the bad reviews on here, because my experience has always been great. The king crab legs are my favorite thing on the menu, besides the shrimp San Remo appetizer which is a must have! I will say, the prices have increased dramatically, so I have not been back in quite some time for dinner. I always start at the bar, and then sit down for dinner. I would go more often and sit at the bar for a drink, appetizer and salad, but you are not allowed to order salad in the bar area. Lou was our favorite bartender for years, and unfortunately he is no longer there. The last time I went, the new bartender was very rude to the people who I was with. I felt embarrassed because they were unhappy with the service, after I just talked the place up. I am guessing over time the inviting atmosphere has changed, and attendtion to detail along with great service has been replaced with making money.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I took my boyfriend here after he said he wanted Beef Wellington for his birthday and I was still too overtaken by Cabo's revenge on my system to make it myself. I had reservations already at Capital Grille, because I saw that Salt Cellar initially had a 3.5 yelp rating. I can honestly say, the Salt Cellar is a pure 5. Upon driving up to Salt Cellar, I was confused by its street 'look'. Its tiny as the restaurant is underground. Stairs, stairs down and we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We had deliberately gone to the Salt Cellar early, so that we could have some oysters on happy hour, (that runs 7 days!), and a couple of drinks prior to dinner. My boyfriend had the $1.50 happy hour Oyster Shooter. Not gonna lie, I was just, icked by that. He loved it though. A raw oyster in a shot glass with a very good cocktail/horseradishy sauce and topped with vodka. Its his birthday.. he can do what he wants! We ordered a app of Oysters Rockefeller. They weren't my favorite, but they were still very good. Some restaurants do rockefeller different and I tend to like mine with a little red sauce involved. At dinner, we started with a very good Emeritus Pinot and the Shrimp San Remo. The San Remo is a specialty here at Salt Cellar. Decent sized prawns in a garlic, wine, butter, sun dried tomatoe saute; capped with portabello slices. Very good. I think I craved that a day later! Katie, our waitress, was an awesome waiter. She knew her stuff and the menu like the back of her hand. Scott inquired about the Turtle Soup and she graciously  brought him a sample. Dinner was me having a large stuffed lobster tail. Stuffed with scallops and crab meat and baked with a panko breading. I paired it with a filet for $18 more. The Beef Wellington Scott had was melt in your mouth awesome. Needless to say we were full by the time we both had a few bites. The breads are divine. The service is impeccable. I love this place!\",\n",

The clam chowder was not a chowder, it was the runniest soup I had ever had. Flavor was average. The crab cake appetizer however was very filling and flavorful. The calamari however was the absolute worst. The consistency was horrid and the smell was incredibly rank, it smelt like a stinky foot.

We ordered a shrimp cocktail which was really good, the fresh bread and salads were also tasty. \\n\\nMy husband was surprised at the tiny glass of beer you can order there but he liked it. \\n\\nThe issue was really with the main course. My beef wellington was basically RAW. I saw another photo of a different version on Yelp that looked perfect but mine was so under-cooked. They said they didn't want to let the pastry get burned but I don't think they pan-seared the tenderloin before it was wrapped. I mentioned I am pregnant so having well cooked meat is important. Also, there was something so horribly wrong with the sauce. It was so sour! Yucky. The veggies that came with it were under seasoned at best. \\n\\nMy husband ordered another steak with fried shrimp. His steak was charred on the outside. You cant really get that carbon taste out of your mouth even if the center is good. I don't know if they had a bad night with the beef or if this is what they regularly serve. At $35+ a plate, it was very disappointing.\\n\\nLastly, the snickers cheesecake seemed to be really tasty but it was covered in a chocolate-amaretto sauce. That was not described to us at all and when I tasted this, I knew it had alcohol in it immediately. It was yet another thing I could not eat.\\n\\nThe seafood seemed ok, maybe we should have stuck with that?\\n\\nWe wont be returning.\",\n",

Awesome Happy Hour!!! \\n\\nCame here for happy hour and sat at the bar by the time I left the place was packed and it was a Wednesday! \\n\\nWe started with the shrimp bread - this was not my choice order but I was happily surprised.  It was tasty! \\n\\nOysters were awesome! Fresh!  I like that you can order the amount you want and not get 1/2 dozen or a dozen. $1.5 for each. \\n\\nNext we had the bucket of clams - This was different.  You get the steamed clams in a bucket and the broth and drawn butter in ramekins on the side... the clams had such great flavor and freshness they were great on their own.  \\n\\nI then tried the Manhattan Clam Chowder because not many places in Arizona actually make Manhattan.  I will say it was Ok - it tasted much more like a vegetable stew with a few clams.  I would stick to the traditional New England here. \\n\\nHalibut ceviche - great flavor BUT the fish has been sitting in the citrus too long and was no longer firm - it became mushy.  Lime/Lemon cooks the fish if it sits too long the acid starts to break down the fish. The texture was off.  Like they had made the batch the night before or early that morning and it just got mushy :(  I would give this another go because the flavor mix was great. \\n\\nNow something I didn\\'t try - but the two ladies sitting next to us had ordered the escargot - They said it was absolutely delicious and baked to perfection.  I will take their word for it.  I have had a bad snail experience so I passed on this little dish :) \\n\\nEven though two of the dishes were \"okay\" I still loved it and will be back to try more!  Definitely recommend if you are looking for some yummy seafood.',\n",

My husband had grouper with a so-called thai sauce. The grouper with decent quality but that I thought was Mae ploy direct from the bottle from Safeway or any other Market. My shrimp scampi have garlic and were swimming in butter to the point it looked like butter soup. So there was nothing interesting or complex about the dishes.

We made reservations here for our anniversary dinner knowing what a phx staple this place is. table was ready which woudlnt have been a problem considering that the place was empty. My hubby had the scallops and lobster which were average at best. I had the steak ordered rare it came more medium and wasnt that tasty. For the price i just wasnt impressed. there is a ton of great food in the area and i wont be returning. it wasnt all bad the wait staff was very friendly and the oysters were ok. just the quality isnt there for the price.',\n",

For cooked seafood in Arizona, this is as good as it gets. \\n\\nThe bar offers a nice variety of single-malt scotch, cognac, and even a few armagnacs. One of the bartenders, Dale, knows his spirits well and has a knack for remembering his customers. The drink prices are also quite reasonable. \\n\\nThe bread baskets are generously full and pair well with every sauce on the menu. We're partial to the bread with kalamata olives baked in, because seriously, they're kalamata olives! No further explanation required. :)\\n\\nWe've enjoyed the following dishes:\\n\\n- Scallop in cream sauce with crab/shrimp (Perfect dish, esp. with the bread.)\\n- Halibut cheeks (Rich and delicious.)\\n- Filet Mignon (This isn't a steakhouse, but they still do a pretty good job on this one.)\\n- Salmon Wellington (Try as you might, you simply cannot eat it all.)\\n\\nUltimately, we find our way back to the scallops with cream sauce. It's our favorite dish, and it never fails to amaze.\\n\\nWe always enjoy top-notch service, food, and spirits in this restaurant. What a blessing to live a mile from there! :)\\n\\nNOISE-SENSITIVE DINERS: When making your reservation, find out if large parties are seated at the same time or in the same room as your table. Noise is a problem as this restaurant is underground and the walls reflect everything. Try to book during off-peak hours if you can. We love this place, but we love it because we eat outside of peak hours. \\n\\n^^^ Parents with screaming children, or children with screaming parents: Take note and book your reservations during happy hour. :-)\\n\\nSUV DRIVERS: The parking lot is small and offers little maneuverability; especially during happy hour. Parking on the side street is your best bet for a smooth exit.\",\n",

Initially, we got reintroduced to Dale, the bartender who has been there since 1987.  He initially offerred to let us taste a couple of Chardonnays when we were unable to select one.  We then had a combined serving of steamed clams and mussels (half priced on the Happy hour menu (4-7).  The Shrimp San Rameo was excellent.  8 shrimp with portobello mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes, along with garlic aND onion.  Great combination.  \\nDinner is why we are raving about this place.  My Beef Wellington was the absolute best.  They use actual pate.  It was perfectly cooked, baked, and the filet was rare.  Marvelous.  Their idea of surf and turf is to include a whole 1 1/4 lb.

       "  'text': \"This place was incredible. Took my In-Laws here for anniversary dinner while we were in AZ for a family wedding and they were more than pleased. While semi-exensive, the atmosphere is not too fancy or over the top, in fact it is classy and quaint. After reading other reviews, I saw that I should order the baked stuffed lobster and am I happy i did. It is one of their signature dishes and they do it right, it is very similar to lobster thermidor minus the heavy sauce. My wife had some turtle soup which was unique and tasty. (don't worry animal lovers, it was snapping turtle they used!)  FOr seafood in AZ, you need to visit Salt Cellar and view their wide array of fresh fish. Great wine selection too including local vino. Can't beat the experience and our waitress was over the top and spot on.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A friend and I went here for our first time for my birthday dinner...the food was delicious unfortunately the service was awful which is the reason for 2 stars. We ordered escargot,  oysters rockafeller, crab legs, ahi tuna, a $70 bottle of wine, snickers cheesecake, lava cake, and cappuccinos. So not only did we try quite a few items we also spent a lot for 2 people. From the moment we walked downstairs and met up with hostess and got ignored for a few minutes when we were the only ones there. I mean the hostess was five feet from us and only gave us a weird look until another gal came and sat us. The server seemed as tho we were a nuisance from the moment we sat down. They refused to assist with blue cheese stuffed olives and had to ask several times for a side of olives and blue cheese so we could stuff a couple ourselves. How can you claim fine dining and not have blue cheese stuffed olives for martinis? Ok that was just the tip of the iceberg. Did not get bread until main course and several requests. Not once did anyone refill our glasses of water. I actually had to get up myself and get the pitcher of water to refill our glasses. We topped off our own wine glasses every time. Our table was a mess. Plates wouldn't get cleaned off unless I asked. And don't order a cappuccino because it's definitely asking for too much. We are advocates of local fine dining but bad service can definitely ruin the overall experience. Dissapointed\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Salt Cellar\\n550 N Hayden Rd.\\nScottsdale, AZ 85257\\n\\nCompanion and I arrived for a 5:00 dinner reservation just a bit early. We were asked to wait in the bar, which would not have been a problem except that every seat was already taken with people waiting. After a short wait, we were seated at our table. \\n\\nThe bar waitress arrived quickly and took our drink order - 20 year old port for myself and a pink squirrel for companion. The port was a Graham and was excellent, and companion loved the pink squirrel. It is notable that the bar has a large stock of premium single malts, ports, and other spirits. Best of all, they have a bartender that has knowledge of what is being served and knows what he/she is doing.\\n\\nWe started our dinner with a bowl of chowder - Manhattan for companion and New England for myself. The chowder had lots of clams and potatoes in it, and instead of being thick and goopy (is that even a word?) it had a nicer, thinner texture that was very enjoyable.\\n\\nNext came an order of Steamed Mussels. They were satisfactory except that many of the shells did not have a mussel in them. Our waitress made things right very quickly by bringing us a steaming hot new order to replace those. The mussels were cooked perfectly and came with a broth and a melted butter cruet to dip them in. Best of all, the mussels were totally clean with not a drop of foreign material in them.\\n\\nNext came the salad, perhaps the only weak point in the meal. Two problems presented themselves - first was that the salad itself was either torn into small pieces that were hard to get on the fork, and other pieces were too big to be put in ones mouth without being cut up. The second problem was that we selected the house vinaigrette, which just really wasn't to my personal taste. Not wanting to be a complainer, I ate the salad and accepted it as part of the experience.\\n\\nThe main course arrived next - baked stuffed lobster. Each lobster was stuffed with a mixture of crab meat and scallops, then covered in bread crumbs and baked. The lobsters are smaller ones - about 1 ¼ pounds I would guess, but after the appetizers and the salad they were more than adequate. The lobsters come with a candle heater with drawn butter in it. I prefer a good salt butter to eat with my seafood, and somehow, miraculously, a small packet of Maldon Sea Salt appeared from my purse to help with the butter. The lobster was delicious and nicely cooked. Our waitress, when serving it took the hard parts apart for us so the eating it was simple and non-messy. \\n\\nOur only unfortunate part of the evening was that we were seated next to a buffoon cardiologist that insisted on recounting his latest surgery experiences to his table in loud enough tones that the entire dining room found out about his sutures. I did not allow that to affect my appetite though.\\n\\nService and cleanliness were excellent as was the food.\\n5 stars\",\n",

       "  'text': \"My husband and I love planning date nights that include a trip to the famous Salt Cellar. We missed happy hour this time but if you have never been, certainly take advantage of their happy hour. It's full of great drink specials and delicious food! We went to the bar for drinks and apps this past Saturday and had such a great time. The bartenders are always attentive, even refilling my wine glass when it was getting low, and they have wonderful recommendations if you need them. We got the oysters on the half shell and wow those were tasty! My husband said they were the best he's had! We also got the flash fried scallops and they were amazing. The chips that came with them were not my cup of tea- a bit tough for me but my husband enjoyed them. We also got fish and chips, which again came with the same chips as the scallops, and the fish was super flaky and fresh. We took our time and enjoyed every morsel of food. Highly recommend getting over there and snagging a spot at the bar. Next time we'll try the dining area for crab legs and lobster. \\n\\nNote:: there is a limited menu in the bar area but there really are plenty of options. I saw a review below that says you cannot eat in the bar area, that's untrue. You can eat there however any dinner entrees are not served in the bar area. The website clearly points this out as well.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Last night my boyfriend and I went to the Salt Cellar. It was both of our first times. Upon being seated, we ordered a bottle of wine. At that time, we also had a few questions regarding the menu. Our cocktail server informed us she would not be able to help. After our server opened our wine, she also told me to wait another few minutes before we could begin asking. Our entire dining experience was this way. Our server was snappy and had zero personality. We asked if she would mind taking a photo of us. Both came out blurry and with her finger in the photo. It was apparent we were not a priority and she did not want to be around us. However, considering the restaurant had few tables I don\\'t understand why. She quickly moved us through each course, even asking to take my boyfriends plate as he was eating. When our main dish arrived (blackened halibut, and stuffed lobster) it was Delicious but once again she attempted to speed us through that as well. I\\'m not sure as to why, considering the restaurant had two more hours left until closing. By the time our meal was completed and we were finishing our wine 4 different people asked if we were finished drinking. It was obvious we were slowly sipping our wine and chatting. However, one lady even asked if we wanted another bottle before we were close to done with the first. Our bill was nearly $200.00. We were not cheap customers in the slightest. My boyfriend still tipped this woman 20 percent which she clearly did not deserve. On the way out the door the host asked how was your meal. We answered \"okay\" and she said, \"alright goodnight\". Salt Cellar only gets two stars because their food was delicious. Their service on the other hand was majorly lacking. I pray no one gets our grumpy server.',\n",

       "  'text': 'I read other Yelp reviews before coming here and ordered accordingly: Shrimp San Remo and Stuffed Lobster. Both are very good. Shrimp San Remo is in a buttery, garlicky herb-filled broth with a slightly spicy aftertaste. The shrimp are average-sized - not too big, definetly not too small, and surround large chunks of portabella mushroom. \\nFilet mignon came out cooked to perfection and King crab legs are enormous and cracked tableside by your server, as are lobster claws. \\nThe lobster is stuffed with a bread mix that contains king crab and scallops. The scallops are whole and a little over an inch in diameter. I counted two. I felt that the stuffing was a little over-the-top as it detracted from the lobster itself, which IMO should be the star of the plate. But that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t good and I would recommend it to anyone going to The Salt Cellar for the first time, I just might not order it next time. \\nSome other Yelp reviews mentioned a \"musty\" smell - I didn\\'t notice this at all. As in, there was no smell. \\nWe had a five-star experience with excellent food paired with top-notch service with genuine smiles and friendliness all around. However, I have to dock a star for veggies and bread. They\\'ll charge you a couple of bucks extra for bread to go with the shrimp, which I found odd as clearly, you need something to sop up all that tasty flavor. And the steamed veggies on the plate (zucchini, cauliflower, carrots) were obviously from a pre-cut frozen bag. The dinner salad was bagged, too - the iceberg blend that Dole carries, right down to the skinny carrot slivers. I mean, this is kind of a high-end place, so I wasn\\'t digging that at all.',\n",

I believe wholeheartedly that boils down (No Pun intended) to three things: Atmosphere, Food Quality, and Service. \\n\\nI actually found this place just asking around at my local barber shop for a quality place to take my lady for a nice night out, and boy did I stumble on to a gold mind.\\n\\nWe had clam chowder and the sauteed Shrimp San Remo, and then as far as entree's go we did the Stuffed Lobster and she had the Salmon. Both we're mind blowing, I mean we're talking ridiculously fantastic. Kudos to the salt cellar.\\n\\nI've also heard that Happy Hour here is super legit, buckets of clams and brews for days, We'll be back to try out HH.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I first ate at the Salt Cellar as a child with my parents.  I have a nice memory of having lobster.  It was fun to go to a restaurant underground, and at the time (in the 80's) it was considered a really fancy place to go.  \\n\\nSo that was the 80's and unfortunately, Salt Cellar is stuck in the 80's.  It still was kinda cool going down the stairs to the restaurant, but it felt like the air wasn't clean.  Seemed dank.  The bar looked nice, but the lighting in the restaurant were those weird orange ones.  Mood lighting?  Seemed depressing and old.  The pictures on the wall looked like were the same ones that were there in the 70's.  This place needs a make over!!!\\n\\nWe were seated and they took my fiance's drink order.  He was very clear about no water in his old fashioned.  It was served with water.  He sent it back, and it came back the same way.  Finally he just ordered straight bourbon. \\n\\nMy fiancé had oysters and I had halibut ceviche. The oysters were gritty. The ceviche had a very sour taste and was loaded with red peppers. I think they used lemon instead of lime.  I couldn't finish it. Nasty!\\n\\nMain course I had the Salmon Oscar. The salmon was amazing, but it was ruined from being drowned in a very bad hollandaise. It tasted like glue. No lemon flavor. It was just bad!  I squeezed some lemon on it to try to fix it, but it was not working. Too much sauce and it was just awful!\\n\\nMy fiancé ordered halibut cheeks that were pretty good, but the vegetables were so over cooked and drowned in butter. The baked potato was decent. \\n\\nI felt sick from the nasty hollandaise so we got the check and left. Disappointing!\\n\\nSalt Cellar is stuck in the past and in need of a makeover.  I was afraid of this, but went for nostalgic reasons.  Too bad. We won't be back!\",\n",

The food was exceptional, from appetizer (shrimp San Remo) to dessert. The bread was NY quality. We had to fight our urge to gorge on it, after so many months with no quality bread here in AZ. The Halibut was superb, fresh moist and cooked to perfection. I had the Wellington and OMG so good. Tender and cooked to perfection as well. Our only issue was a very annoying and loud couple next to us, who came in at the end of our meal and made sure the whole restaurant knew they were there. Since we cannot control knuckleheads seating, I will not let it affect my score. But people, if you are in a dark, romantic quiet place, bring your volume down to that level.

It\\'s almost impossible to notice this place even if you drive by it everyday, from the outside you\\'d never thought it\\'d hold more than 10 customers.  Once I opened the door, I went \"oOo\", you walk down the stairs and end up in a basement w/ great ambiance.  The bar is just big enough for you to get great service from the bartender.  The happy hour is great at the bar area if you just want to stop by after work, the only think I had an issue with is that they don\\'t have much beer selection on tap.  \\nAfter a few appetizers and drinks, we moved to the table, and the smell(smells salty, perhaps from all the sea food they have in the kitchen) and the lighting made me feel like I was on a boat.  There are so many interesting items on the menu, and we went for what we all wanted, lobster & crab.  If it wasn\\'t for my friend\\'s BD, I doubt I\\'d come here for regular dinner just cuz of the expensive menu...The server was wonderful, cracked all the lobster and crab for us, and also explained the menu clearly for us.  He always came on time(not too often, but never late) to ask if we need to refill a drink, or get a dessert.  The most interesting thing for me is probably the turtle soup, I thought it was great! It kind of reminded me of the chinese herbal soup my mom always cook...and yes, every exotic animal tastes like chicken...\\n\\noverall, could be a 5 star restaurant for me if they had enough beer selection, or less expensive, but then again, it IS in Scottsdale, so if you got the $$, I\\'d highly recommend you to check it out!',\n",

       "  'text': \"Ugggh. Where do I start.  My fiancé and I were going out for my birthday. He said pick a nice place. I googled a few places in Scottsdale and decided on seafood versus pasta. That was my 1st mistake.   We arrived for our reservation and were immediately seated.  We were promptly greeted by our server and ordered our drinks. Right away I told the server that it was our 1st time there and that we drove from Surprise to Scottsdale just to try out their food.  I ordered the clam chowder as a starter.   Holy cow was this bad.  Progresso has better clam chowder. The chowder was super watery and was not hot at all. We then talked about the menu and I ordered the baked stuffed lobster.  She really didn't spend a lot of time with us, but that's because she was super busy, and I can appreciate that.  Anyways, the lobster came.  She asked if I wanted it cracked and I said yes. She literally cracked the lobster with her bare hands.  Is this normal?!!  But that wasn't my concern, my concern was the lobster was soooo disgusting. It was cold, chewy and had zero flavor. The stuffing was dry and tasted like a bad stove top box. The scallops inside the stuffing had no flavor and chewy. I didn't even taste the supposed crab in the mix.  My fiancé tried it too and he said it was horrible so I know it wasn't just me.  She came back and asked how everything was and she could tell by the look on my face and offered a new dish. I went simple and got the grilled shrimp.  Which was pretty good. BUT I didn't drive 35 miles for some grilled shrimp. I was so disappointed.  She offered me my bday dessert and I got the lava cake.  Another disappointment. It was cold and nothing special.  I am super bummed I picked this place as there were so many other options. The server was very nice and I don't have anything bad to say about her. It was just the horrible food.  Red Lobster blows this place away.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Went for first time based on all the positive reviews for my birthday  on June 30th....very disappointed. Started with steamed clams, very dry with no juice or broth in the bottom of the kettle, so they were kind of bland and rubbery. My wife had the halibut and it was overcooked and dry. When we told our server he offered to bring some lemon butter sauce.....how about offering to take it back and have it prepared correctly. Only after insisting for a replacement did he take it back. After removing the empty bread plate, never offered to bring us more bread. I had the king crab which was good,  shared it with my wife so she could eat with me while we waited for he entree to come back. Our waiter passed by the table several times while our water glasses sat empty. He eventually refilled them after clearing the plates from the table....a little late at the point. The cocktail waitress passed by and saw our sparkling waters were empty and brought us new ones. It would have been nicer to have refills during our meal. In my opinion, though I'm sure the quality of their raw ingredients are good, both the prep and the service were lacking. I've had moister seafood at Red Lobster. Think I will stick with restaurants of the caliber of Morton's for my future celebrations.\",\n",

It was quite an interesting experience, but it seemed like there was no entrances for wheelchair customers.  When you enter, you feel like you are in a fisherman's wharf.  The smell of fish was a little too strong for my liking, but I covered my nose and walked in.  The smell was not too bad at the dining area.  The dining area is very small, and you need to make reservations online if you want to ensure seating.  I was not happy with the seating arrangements as each table felt like you were inches away from the next party.  All the conversations were very quiet because it seemed like the privacy was ruined.\\n\\nWe got some bread and salad to start off with.  The bread had an olive in it, and it tasted very funny.  The salad vegetables tasted kind of stale to me.  I ordered Alaskan King Crab, and it was actually quite good.  I enjoyed the fact the server opened it up for me.  Its 1.5 lbs, but you don't get as much of the crab.  My friend got the Salmon, and it was pretty solid too.  We ended the night with a giant waffle cone banana gelato dessert.\\n\\nOverall the food was decent, but I think the ambiance with the fish and closeness of tables brings it from a 4 star to 3 star experience.\",\n",

The tuna and the halibut were being heavily pushed. Four of us ordered halibut and one of us ordered the tuna. All four of us agreed that the halibut was gross. It looked malformed as if it wasn't even real fish and it was very dry. It also was very bland. The Cous cous was a mound of mushy pasta balls, not even really couscous. The bread was cold and dry. One of my friends told our waiter twice that she didn't like the fish. He ignored her both times and even asked her if she wanted to box it up. I guess he didn't hear what she was saying? None of us complained about the food but I hope to never be back to this restaurant again. Also I was in danger of walking to my car at night in this area because it's shady, there are barely any streetlights and there were two or three wayward looking homeless people milling about in the dark. The parking lot is too small to fit everyone's car. Oh and also, today I have a very upset stomach. Two thumbs down.\",\n",

The best chardonnay I've had in a long time! I also had the David Bruce pinot noir, which was well balanced with a pleasant array of berry notes, yet still quaffable, and a great way to close the evening.\\n\\nI only gave it 4 stars because I have yet to try an entree, which I will since I will definitely return.

Their absolute favorite food is seafood and being that they live in a place where great seafood is available everywhere, I wanted to take them someplace that would not disappoint. Anytime I have ever asked anyone where to get good seafood at in Arizona, the answer has always been The Salt Cellar.  \\n\\nI want to start off by saying the service staff in every aspect was stellar.  We showed up with one more person than we had anticipated and the hostesses were quick to make the last minute accommodation. The ladies in your bar were so sweet, and our server was amazing. \\n\\nIn regards to the food, my sister and I ordered oysters on the half shell, which were the best we have ever had. My mom got the crab stuffed shrimp and really enjoyed it. My sister and I also split the crab legs and filet. Unfortunately, this is where things take a different direction.  Crab legs were great, but the medium filet was not seasoned at all and was chewy.  My fifteen year old son got the filet and shrimp.  He liked the shrimp, but said the steak was not good, and he usually likes, and will pretty much eat everything with no complaints. My grandfather\\'s fish was overcooked, and my grandmother\\'s fried shrimp was soggy.  We had cold veggies on our plates that tasted like they were warm at one time, but had sat out for quite awhile.  \\n\\nLet me just say, money is not the issue here.  Our bill was 317 dollars after tip, for an average of about 53 dollars per person. Totally reasonable for a great meal. When it comes to amazing food, service and atmosphere I would pay double that.  I do realize this is a seafood restaurant, however for the amount of money that is being charged I would expect to leave feeling that EVERYTHING was amazing.  I originally thought about going to The Keg which is similarly priced. I have ordered different steak and seafood dishes there many times and each time said to my husband, \"Oh my God. I loved every part of that dinner!\" However, I wanted to take my grandparents to a local restaurant and not a chain restaurant that they could go to anytime in Florida. After hearing the great things about this restaurant, I decided to take a chance and go here instead. I was honestly SO surprisingly disappointed and to be frank, embarrassed that I suggested it. It was just, eh. Everyone left saying \"It was ok, but not great.\" My mom and sister who also live here said it was totally not what they had expected. \\n\\nI did not want to tell the server about this in front of my whole family when he asked how everything was, not to mention we were in a hurry and could not have had our dinners remade at that time had they offered. So I decided to return home and email the manager. In her response she just proceeded to tell me that the issue is their food supplier and not the preparation. She made absolutely no attempts to regain our service. I would have given this restaurant at least three stars but after receiving her reply bumped it down to a 1.',\n",

Once she made her way to me she had no personality and did not smile. She may have just rolled out of bed but it was clear she would rather be anywhere but here working. She brought me the wine in a dirty glass and did not offer water or bread which she did for the other ladies near the register. I had to wait awhile and she brought my food over - never brought the bread out after I had asked. As 4 more sat down she said hello without any enthusiasm or smile. I would do yourself a favor and drive a half mile to Kings Fish Market at Tempe market place for the service.

       "  'text': 'I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday last month. He loves seafood and last year I took him to Ocean Club which was outrageously expensive with mediocre food. So I thought I would try something different and took him to SC. Totally pleasantly surprised!\\n\\nWe had two drinks each, he had the stuffed lobster and I had crab legs. Both entrees came with potatoes, veggies and a side salad. They brought out bread and butter before, and for his birthday a free piece of Snickers cheesecake at the end. The food was DELICOUS... and a lot of it. Neither of us could finish it all.\\n\\nThe bill ended up being about $85, and I was shocked, expecting way more. Very happy about that!\\n\\nThe atmosphere is fun, its all underground with a cool little bar. You can dress up if you want, but you could also go totally casual. I like having that option.\\n\\nI will definitely return and have already been recommending this place to a lot of my clients. 5 stars!',\n",

I ordered the lemon caper halibut and took half of it and some vegetables home. Later that evening I went to heat up the leftovers only to find a maggot in it. Awesome. Now I wonder how many maggots I ate while at the restaurant? \\nCan't do it . \\n\\n 9/30:\\nBefore I could even respond to the message from The Salt Cellar through my Yelp account I received this on Facebook. I feel not only is this completely disrespectful but this establishment doesn't give any care into making a situation right or taking care of a customer. Disappointing to say the least. The maggot looking worm came out of the vegetables. I'm well aware of your seafood practices and the care that is taken, which is why I frequented the restaurant. \\nDefinitely never going back now and moving forward. This is not okay.\\n \\nLet me just add the MULTIPLE times that I did not receive an appetizer or side of crab legs that we ordered, and there is always an excuse rather than an apology...and yet I forgave and returned to the restaurant. Unbelievable\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been to the Salt Cellar a few times a very long time ago. This place hasn't changed at all. Small parking lot and a lot of people park on the street. Lots of street parking too. So you walk down two flights of stairs to the bar area and the hostess stand. Very small area with a few cozy dinning areas. Dim lights and romantic setting. All adults and no kids. \\n\\nWe started off with the New England Clam Chowder. It's a huge bowl with lots of clams. Really good and the complimentary bread was so good and soft. Very fresh. We also had the Calamari skewer which came with four calamari on a stick with two different dipping sauces. Calamari was cooked perfectly and not too chewy. It was good not not great. \\n\\nSo with your dinner you get a salad. I was thinking this was a small dinner salad but no this was a huge salad. A normal salad but with the chowder, calamari, and bread. We ordered way too much. 3 out of the 5 people in our party were full after the salad. It was way too much food before our entree. \\n\\nAnyways, I ordered the Salmon Wellington. The salmon was wrapped around spinach with a nice crusty outside. The salmon was moist and good. It came with a small baked potato and mixed vegetables. Nice meal and lots of food. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Mahi-Mahi with macadamia nuts with a baked potato and grilled vegetables. Like I said before she ate so much she had to take home her entree. Same thing with my son. He ordered the New York Strip with baked potato and grilled vegetables. \\n\\nMy daughter had the Turtle soup because she never had this before. Black soup and I stole a bite and it was pretty good. She really liked it. They gave a little shot glass with wine in it where they burned off the liquor and you pour in the soup so it's not too thick. Like I said she loved the soup. She also had the Salmon Oscar with asparagus. She gobbled that down and didn't complain so I guess she really liked it. \\n\\nThe service was great. They had multiple people serving you by clearing out the dishes and always filling your water cups. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful. \\n\\nIt was a really good with lots of food, good food, great service, and a really romantic ambiance. Just remember to be careful with the appetizer. So much food but well worth it. I enjoyed it. Very different with the underground restaurant. Enjoy.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Since we had been planning to go here, I've been reading the various reviews.  \\n\\nI was a little nervous, because many people mentioned it being a very small enclosed dining room where the tables are practically on top of each other...I am claustrophobic, so I became quite tentative about that.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it not as small as I assumed.  The restaurant is basically 3 areas: the bar, the main dining room and a smaller dining room--each separated by a wall and windows.  The main dining room (where we sat) did have about 12 tables.  There were some that seemed close to each other, but there were also a few private booths and other tables.  We sat at a separate table, and didn't feel like we were on top of anyone near us.  \\n\\nOur server was Tony, who was quite knowledgeable about every question we asked.  He was also very friendly and quite attentive.\\n\\nNow onto the food...It was outstanding!  The bread was quite large, but so soft.  We ordered iced teas (the only part of the meal we didn't seem to enjoy), and they're flavored.  I prefer just plain.  It had a strange lemony flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  However, that was a very slight hiccup along the way.  For our appetizers, I had the Maryland crab cakes, which were divine.  They were practically all crab, something that I'm not used to with some places that serve crab cakes.  And, they were served with a delicious dijon mustard sauce.  My husband got the New England clam chowder, and if we weren't in a restaurant, he would've licked the bowl.  He loved it!  We had the salad, I had the Italian/Bleu cheese vinaigrette and he had the Thousand Island dressing.  They were fine, nothing too exciting, but good.  For our entrees, I had the Beef Wellington and my husband had the Shrimp & Filet.  I had never had Beef Wellington before, and I'm glad I had it here.  It has become one of my favorites.  The beef was so moist and tender, and the pastry wasn't sweet, but had a wonderful savory quality.  My husband kept raving about the shrimp and the cocktail sauce, plus he said that the steak was cooked to perfection and melted in his mouth.\\n\\nWe were so full, we didn't have dessert.  Overall, it was an amazing experience, and we will definitely come back for more.\",\n",

Or, maybe it's because it is just the coolest seafood place ever!\\n\\nYou walk in and it's just stairs heading downstairs to the underground bar and restaurant.  As you walk up to the host/hostess you pass by the live lobster tank and take a look at which one you are going to feast on later.  Or, you walk right past the host/hostess and head straight to the bar.  Such a cool bar, solid wood and very classy, old school Charleston Era / Speak Easy vibe.  They have a decent happy hour in the bar with a pretty extensive food choice on it until 7pm.  In fact, lately when I go, I typically sit in the bar and order Happy Hour items.\\n\\nThis is one of those places, if you haven't been you have to check it out just to say you've been there.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Hello to all my fellow foodies :)\\n\\nHere it is 2 years after my first experience and for some odd reason I chose to celebrate my birthday again at Salt Cellar.  I was really craving some seafood and at the time I forgotten just how poor the first experience was....so.... a group of us met at the tiny overcrowded bar area.\\n\\nWe were allowed to bring our appetizers to the table and still pay the \"happy hour\" prices... I though this was decent of them.\\n\\nI was craving scallops and asked more than once if scallops were in season, as I know there are certain times of the year when such items are \"in season\" therefore providing a fresher delicacy.\\n\\nThe one thing I really enjoyed the last time was their bread... it was crusty and soft and absolutely delicious.  I was told the bread is the same as it always was....NOT!\\n\\nDont tell me what you think I want to hear!  The bread was NOTHING like it used to be....this time is was simply \"bread\"....nothing at all good or special about it.\\n\\nAfter many appetizers, we were served our salad...again, nothing special..very basic, except for mine... I guess I got the birthday surprise... a long hair attached to a piece of lettuce! DISGUSTING... \\n\\nI showed the waiter who was very professional about it and seemed almost embarassed.\\n\\nThe group of us tried several items.  I got the scallops...after being assured they are in season and very good... Why do I bother to ask, when I know they cant say something like \"oh no...dont go with the scallops, they are small and not really the time of year for them\" and you\\'ll regret it!\\n\\n\\nThese small morsels were overcooked and rubbery and lacked any flavor!\\n\\nA couple people got surf and turf and the steak also lacked any flavor/seasoning and was not cooked to was was requested.\\n\\nThe lobster, I was told was o.k but nothing to rave about.\\n\\nWe experiemented with some shrimp toast which I really cant describe because I am not sure what it tasted like other than salty...couldnt not detect the shrimp taste.\\n\\n\\nI returned my scallops and after the hair and rubbery food had no desire to try anything else.\\n\\nThe owner had come over to the table and apologized for the \"series of events\", his excuse for the hair being that due to the ventilation system hair and partical will fly around... (which of course has to land somewhere...why not my salad) \\n\\nThey removed my scallops from the check....duhhhh any mediocore place would do the same.\\n\\nI would like to give a special THANK YOU to our waiter.. my apologies for not remembering your name, but he was terrific!  Friendly, quick and when we needed him...he was around.\\n\\nWe got out of there with what I feel is a HIGH price to pay for such a distasteful experience.\\n\\nWhen I got home and after hearing my friends give their critique of my choice of restaurant to celebrate at I was pretty unhappy!\\n\\nI felt the owner, although a nice man, did not care enough about his customers to do something a little \"above and beyond\" to apologize for the experience and try to keep a customer.\\n\\nI called the restaurant and spoke with the owner and told him I was very dissapointed and felt that he should have done something more than make excuses.. he kept apologizing and I assured him none of the 5 of us would every return to Salt Cellar.\\n\\nHe finally said he would like to do something for me and asked for my address.\\n\\nHere it is a couple weeks later...not sure why he wanted my address...maybe he is gonna picket my house or send mean letters...who knows... he never did anything!\\n\\nIt is clear to see why his restaurant is not packed as it was years ago....You may have the repeat business from those who have been patronizing your establishment from back in the day when your food was actually good, or there were no other options for seafood...but guess what?  There are other options!\\n\\nAt this point in my review I usually suggest you go and try for yourself...but this time I am going to save you the time and money....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!\\n\\nYou will be glad you did.\\n\\nAs for the owner of Salt Cellar....apologies and excuses are simply words....Stand behind your restaurant...you should have wanted to prove to me that you do a better job than was we experienced.\\n\\nYou are cutting too many corners to save money and it is costing you your customers!\\n\\nYour actions speak for themselves!\\n\\nIt used to be when you mention Salt Cellar people would ooohhh and ahhh...those days are gone, most of the people I mention it to have no idea what Salt Cellar is.\\nThat speaks VOLUMES!\\n\\nAnd so I say... Bon Appetite\\'',\n",

       "  'text': 'I worked at the Salt Cellar for over 11 years and I recently started a new restaurant job in Sacramento, CA. Just the other day a table of mine caught wind of the fact that I just moved here from Scottsdale and immediately said, \"My favorite restaurant is in Scottsdale, It\\'s called The Salt Cellar!\" Needless to say I was extremely proud to inform her that I had spent the last 11 years of my life working at her favorite restaurant. Now with that being said I feel like I need to make a couple comments about a few of the reviews I just read...\\nWhen you go to dine at The Cellar you need to know that it is more than a restaurant, it is an experience. Most people choose to come for special occasions like birthdays or Anniversaries. By the way, they offer a complimentary dessert for those occasions. Most people can not afford the luxury of dining at a pricey restaurant regularly although there are plenty of regular customers that dine there. In my opinion you get what you pay for and if you want to eat FRESH seafood in the middle of the desert, you are going to pay a pretty penny for it. Go to the coast if you don\\'t like the gas prices it takes to ship fresh fish in on a daily basis. The food there is pure. By that I mean it is not spruced up with glazes and sauces to mask the true flavor of the fish you ordered. Some people may think that is bland. But I think if the chef masked the fish with other flavors, he might as well buy it frozen. My last point about the price is, there is no a la carte. When you order an entree there it comes complete with a salad, bread and two sides. I have seen people leave the place leaning forward because their full bellies wouldn\\'t allow them to stand up straight. \\nThere is a review stating that the place is not kid friendly because they don\\'t carry high chairs. Well, personally that is an incentive for me since I don\\'t have kids and would rather not listen to them scream while I\\'m enjoying my dinner. However, they are very kid friendly. The owner has two beautiful granddaughters who have been dining there since birth. And if you happen to get Cara as a waitress she will probably take your child on a tour of the restaurant to give you a break while you enjoy your meal. It doesn\\'t get much more kid friendly than that!\\nIt may seem like my opinion is a little biased, but I have nothing to gain from this review other than spreading the word that this unique little gem of a restaurant needs to be experienced by you. If you are questioning whether or not to dine there based on the past reviews then please take this one into account. It\\'s a unique and unforgettable place. It\\'s privately owned by a couple that care about every guest that walks in the door. If you don\\'t like your dinner, do yourself and the restaurant a favor and say something. Your server will get you a new one or something different. No questions asked. They want you to walk out the door happy as much as you do. \\nOne last thing, in my opinion the best item on the menu is the Alaskan King Crab. Not only is it mouthwatering delicious. Your server will crack it table side for you!',\n",

I\\'ve been going there for years and years and the past few visits have gotten worse and worse with this past visit the one that broke the camels back and I will never return.  It started with a cold attitude from the hostess, the fun kept going with very bad service at the bar before dinner,  (we were virtually ignored for 10 minutes after sitting down), the mussels about made us sick, the bread at dinner came out as three big slabs of under baked dough, the salads were just thrown together with vegetables that were old,  I sent my $40.00 filet back as it was the worst steak I\\'ve ever had (the waitress said it was the third one she returned that night!)  ZERO seasoning and over cooked.  I mentioned it to or waitress who said \"well its just over cooked around the edges\"  REALLY!!  They may want to replace everyone in the back as they obviously don\\'t care what they put out.  My girl friends steak and crab legs were bad as well.  And then to top it off, desert came out and it looked like something my 12 year old son put on a plate. Also, it was so cold in there, everyone was complaining and nothing was done until we were ready to leave!!   Not sure if they have new ownership/management but with all the good restaurants in town they will soon close their doors with this kind of service/food.  \\n\\nAgain, sad to see this place circling the drain .. but it was a good run.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Do people in AZ not know what good seafood is?  I went here based on the decent amount of good reviews.  There aren't many seafood restaurants in the Phoenix area and I've always been curious about this underground place.  First impression was this place looks like going to my grandma's house for dinner.  The decor was old, smelled musty, and it was dark as hell.  I thought the food here must be phenomenal to carry its other shortcomings.  I was wrong.  EVERYTHING was overcooked.  Calamari, halibut cheeks, ahi tuna all overcooked!  Why would you overcook Ahi?!  You don't have to worry about food poisoning from undercooked seafood here.  Clams were steamed so it was hard to overcook but they didn't use any seasoning.  I could have cooked that at home.  Looking around it seemed like the only people who still come here and think this place is good are the senior citizens.  We were the youngest ones eating there on the saturday night.  I'll end this review on the positive note.  The carrot cake was good.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"WOW!!!! I am SHOCKED that this place has managed to maintain such a high rating. My husband and I went here for our anniversary, Walking in it seemed like a unique place with a unique atmosphere. I could not have been more wrong. \\nWhen we were seated in the dining room we immediately noticed the dated decor. The yellow lights, and brass picture frames with pastel ocean scenes. It was like they haven't changed a thing since the 80's.We were berated by three different people asking us for our drink order when we first sat down, which was not only confusing but annoying. \\n\\nwhen looking at the menu we noticed there was nothing under 40$ which is fine I will gladly pay for an AMAZING meal. I ordered the fillet and Alaskan King Crab legs...I am going to emphasize legs here.\\nMy husband not being a seafood fan ordered the 14oz boneless Rib eye.\\nNow where to start, Our meals came with salad, vegetable of the day, and your choice of a baked potato or rice pilaf. First the salad was Iceberg lettuce but despite that their house dressing was still decent. Now onto the meal Our plates came out and I was SHOCKED and HORRIFIED, My 40 dollar meal consisted of a child's fist sized baked potato, which incidently was the best part of the meal, a pile of vegetables, zucchini, cauliflower, and black olives...yeah think about that for a minute, they where BOILED no seasoning and inedible. My fillet was tiny which was fine I was not expecting a huge hunk of meat, cooked perfectly but had NO seasoning and tasted awful. What a waste for that cow that sacrificed his life to be cooked in this place. Last but certainly not least my Alaskan King Crab leg... yeah that is right ONE leg. When she sat my plate down I just started laughing I could not believe I just wasted 40 on this. The server said wow that's a leg as if I was getting some deal. My husbands meal had the same problems no seasoning and boiled vegetables. Give me a break this place is a joke! I have never payed 100.00 drinks not included for food that was so terrible. I have no clue how this place is in business and I will scream it to the mountain tops DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... Unless of course you like bland inedible food. Go to Red Lobster you'll have a better meal at less money. And that's saying a lot, I try not to eat at chains...\",\n",

We looked on yelp to see what people recommended and the Shrimp San Remo was definitely worth a try! We also got the fresh bread to dip in the sauce! YUM!

       "  'text': \"Went in on a Thursday night with a group of about 20 people for our holiday work dinner. The restaurant itself is very unique. I love that it's a very small building at glance but when you first walk through the door you go down a wide rustic wooden staircase and the restaurant is located completely underground. Unforuntiley there is no elevator so keep that in mind. It's a medium size restaurant with 2 small rooms and a large bar. You can hang out in the bar area while waiting to be seated. \\n\\nThe servers were good! We had 2-3 servers for our large party and additional food/drink runners periodically. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgable of the menu and any questions we had. We were seated at 2 large tables and one of the tables got their food and finished eating before the other table got their food which was a bummer. We had ordered at the same time too. I know it was a large party but that should have never happened. Luckily with the appetizers, bread, and salad we were patient enough to wait for the meal without starving. Not sure if there was a mix up in the kitchen but the servers never addressed that.\\n\\nThere is a ton of menu options for everyone to enjoy. So even if you don't like seafood there was many other great options such as steak and teriyaki chicken. It is a bit pricey but i feel it's fair to the service, portion, and quality food you are served. \\n\\n*** All lobster and crab options are cracked and cut open table-side which is awesome. So don't fear the pain of cracking those crab legs because they do all the work for you!! ***\\n\\nEach entree is served with bread rolls to start, salad, veggies, and baked potato or daily starch. They had some interesting salad dressings to choose from. I went with the tarragon dressing. Honestly, I hated it but it was because it tasted like mayo to me. But that could be totally a personal preference so I just set it aside because I knew I had plenty of other food coming! \\n\\nFood I got:\\n- Appetizer shrimp cocktail was delicious. Served with 5 huge jumbo shrimp and a flavorful spicy cocktail sauce.\\n- Surf and turf with 1.5lb lobster and 7oz filet mignon. It was all incredible. They serve the lobster with a lemon butter that was delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly. Had a great char flavor. \\n\\nOverall I was satisfied aside from the huge delay in food being sent out. I may come back and sit in the bar for happy hour food so that might be a good way to go for a cheaper route.\",\n",
